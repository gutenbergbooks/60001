<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
CERTAIN NOTABLE DETAILS IN GENESIS
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
One John Rawn is to be the hero of this pleasing
tale; no ordinary hero, as you might learn did
you make inquiry of himself.  His history must be set
down in full, from beginning to culmination, from
delicate flowering to opulent fruitage, from early obscurity
to later fame.  Such would be his wish; and the wishes
of John Rawn long have been commands.
</p>

<p>
For the most part the early history of any hero is of
small consequence.  We are chiefly concerned that he
shall be tall and shapely, mighty in war and love, and
continuously engaged therein from the first moment of
his entrance on our scene.  Granted these essentials, we
customarily pass carelessly over any hero's youth, even
as lightly, perchance, over his ancestry.  Not so in the
case of John Rawn.  He himself would say, if asked,
that no hero of so exceptional a merit as his own could
be thus lightly produced; that indeed not even the three
generations accorded to the making of a gentleman
could be called sufficient for the evolution of a personage
of mold such as his.  Let us yield to a will so
imperious, a wish so germane to our own amiable intent.
Mr. Rawn shall have all the generations that he likes.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
John Rawn might, in the caretaking plans of the
immortal gods, have been born at any time in the
world's history, at any place upon the world's surface.
He himself, had he been consulted, might have suggested
Rome, Greece, or medi√¶val England, as offering
better field for one of his kidney.  He might have
indicated certain resemblances between himself and
persons who, through virtue given of the immortal gods,
have attained the purple, who have held permanent
and admitted ascendancy over their fellow-men.  As a
matter of fact, however, John Rawn was born in Texas&mdash;and
of Texas at the very spot where, had it been left
to his own candid opinion, no John Rawn, no especial
hero, ought ever to have been born.  The village he
honored by his birth&mdash;one of seven which now contend
over that claim to fame&mdash;was the very home of
democratic equality; and how could the home of democratic
equality be called typical environment for the production
of a man believing in the divine right of a very
few?
</p>

<p>
Neither, had John Rawn been consulted in the matter,
would he have indorsed the plans of fate in respect
to his ancestry any more than he did the workings of
the misguided stars in regard to his environment.  By
right he should have been the offspring of parents for
long generations accustomed to rule, to command, to
sway the destinies of others.  Yet far from this was
the truth in our hero's case.
</p>

<p>
Which of us can tell what is in an infant's mind?
At what day or hour of a child's life does the
consciousness of human values in affairs first impinge upon
the embryonic mentality?  At what date, first feeling
itself human and not plant, not oyster nor amoeba, can
it logically begin that reproach of its own parentage
which to so many of us is held as a personal right,
convenient and pleasant because it explains away so
many things by way of human failures?  At what time,
at what moment of John Rawn's life did he, lying in
his cradle, and looking up for the first conscious time
into the faces solicitously bending above him, realize
that after all, in spite of all the plans of the watchful
fates, here were no king and queen, no emperor and
empress assigned to him as parents, but only an humble
Methodist preacher and his still more humble wife?
</p>

<p>
Truly here was hard handicap even at the start, that
of both birth and environment, as he himself would
have been first to admit.  Not that it could daunt him,
not that it could cause a soul like his to feel the pangs
of despair.  No; it meant only that much further to
travel, that much higher to climb.  This American
republic was expressly framed for such as Mr. Rawn.
The issue never was to be called in doubt.  From that
first hour of consciousness of his ego which marks the
real birth of a human soul, John Rawn must have said
to himself that success was meant for him; that not all
the hostile array of circumstances, birth, heredity and
environment, could do more than temporarily balk
his aim.  From the cradle, indeed for generations
uncounted&mdash;as many as he likes&mdash;before the cradle, John
Rawn believed in himself.  How can we fail to join
him in that belief?
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
It was rarely that ever a smile enlivened the
somewhat heavy features of young John Rawn, even in the
earliest stages of his babyhood.  Rarely did the mirth
of any situation bring up in his face an answering
dawn of appreciation.  He was a serious child, as all
admitted even from the first.  He grew to be a grave
boy, a solemn youth.  He made no jests, nor smiled at
those of others.  There was a corrugation between his
brows before he was twenty years of age.  In his
declamations at the exercises of the village school, his
hand went instinctively into a bosom not yet ten years
of age; his forelock fell across his brow before he was
twelve; already his gestures were large and wide, his
voice prematurely deep before he had reached
fourteen.  He was of that temperament which, in
accordance with the term, takes itself seriously.  It is
astonishing what virtue lies in that habit.  The world,
sometimes for many years, indeed sometimes permanently,
accepts seriously those who seriously accept
themselves.  Many of the most colossal asses ever born
have not "Ass" written on their tombstones, where
righteously it so very frequently belongs in the history
of the great.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Curious persons might have found certain explanations
for these traits in the calling, the temper and
training of the father of John Rawn.  In that time and
place, a minister of the gospel was a man of whom
all stood in awe.  He was not much gainsaid, not much
withstood, not much disapproved.  His conclusions
were announced for acceptance, not for argument.  At
best he was only to be avoided, if one dreaded the look
of the clerical eye, the denunciation of the clerical
tongue.  Other men might be met, might be antagonized,
might be overcome by fist or thumb or firearms,
per example; not so the parson of the village church.
</p>

<p>
It is an excellent profession; that of minister of the
gospel.  The ranks of none offer better men than the
best types of that profession, large men, strong men,
just men, not doing preaching for a business, but really
wishing to counsel and aid frail humanity as it marches
among the perpetual pitfalls, the perpetual hardships
of human life.  It is an exceedingly good religion of
itself, that merely of helping your fellow-man, of
saying something to soften and better him, of giving to
him something of hope and courage when he is in need
of them.  Let us not argue whether or not a divine
spirit can become mortal, whether or not Christ was
divine.  We know by virtue of abundant human testimony
that He was a great and kindly Man, a great and
adorable Human Being, the greatest of whom we know
in all our human history.  And that man who makes
the creed of the greatest of us all his own, who lives
kindly and helpfully and modestly, with no blare of
trumpet, doing simply and silently that which his
human hands find to do; that man nearest to the greatest
Man of whom we know, the one who went closest to
making human life endurable, who took humanity
farthest away from the cruel creed of the jungle&mdash;that
minister of the gospel, let us say then, who lives as is
possible for one of his calling to live, and attains in that
calling what may be attained, may be, and not
infrequently is, a splendid human being.
</p>

<p>
But he is worth our admiration when he is worth it;
not necessarily otherwise.  A minister of the gospel
may not always be the central figure of that religious
fervor which has come sporadically and spasmodically
to men under many creeds, since man began to think
aloud, to doubt and despair in public, and to pray in
company.  Besides, there are ministers and ministers.
Some are men naturally large and are so accepted.
Others, alas! bulk larger than really they are, by virtue
of the fact that always they apparently have prevailed;
whereas, in truth, they only have met small opposition.
</p>

<p>
'Tis a sweet fashion of life which allows us always
to have our own way!  Nor is it to be denied that
when the preacher stands before the flock, his
disordered hair falling above his brow, his eyes flashing,
his breath sobbing in his emotion; when he hurls
out questions to which he knows there will be no
answer; when he makes one assertion after another to
which he knows there is to be no contradiction; when
he rules, sways, expounds, glorifies, waxing greater in
stature out of the very situation in which he stands&mdash;let
us not deny that he is then in the way&mdash;the simple
and forgivably human way&mdash;of coming more and more
into the belief that he himself is as great as the
doctrines which he expounds.  There are martyrs in
history because of human convictions which led them to
contradict the church.  There are other and far more
numerous martyrs, made such because they dared not
contradict it.
</p>

<p>
Given, then, a man of rawboned frame, of virile
physical health, and of pronouncedly good opinion of
himself, this is perhaps the very profession of all others
which would be most apt to build up that man in his
own eyes into a personage of considerable stature.
Such a man might easily regard himself as set apart
from his fellow human beings&mdash;a feeling which Christ
Himself never had, nor any great man in or out of
history before Him or after Him.  It is understandable
that such a man, of such a profession, might be the very
one to find his philosophy feeding upon itself; with the
net result of an inordinate, ingrown egotism.  And
this ingrown egotism in himself might, in the case of
his son, become an egotism congenital.  There are
ministers of the gospel, and other ministers of the gospel.
John Rawn, Senior, was of this particular and less
desirable sort.  We mention him, having promised our
hero all the analysis and all the generations he may
desire; and being, moreover, commendably anxious
fully to account for him and his many noteworthy
peculiarities.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Had John Rawn, our hero, been able in his childhood
to figure out that, after all, God and the undying
stars had no special grudge against him in assigning
his birth to a humble inland village; had he been able
to picture to himself his real value as a human unit;
had he been able to understand his own explanation,&mdash;that
is to say this explanation of him which we so
patiently have given&mdash;had he been able to qualify his
own mind as that of a congenital egotist, and hence
to see himself naturally come by certain phases of his
character&mdash;he might have smiled and have been
different.  He might one day have extended his hand to his
fellow-man understandingly, might have gone through
life much as other men indeed, dying simply and
without much outcry about it, as most of us do, and living
with small disturbance of the world's equilibrium, as
most of us also do.  But in that deplorable case there
would have been no John Rawn as we know him, and
no story about him worth the telling.  Let us,
therefore, beg to disagree even with him, and not hold it as
entire misfortune that he was born in an unstoried
spot, and of parents one of whom, by reason of his
natural character and of his calling, was wont to
consider himself the partner, and not necessarily the
junior partner, of a Divine Providence.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0102"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
PURELY INCIDENTAL
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
To be sure John Rawn had a mother, but that is
merely an incidental matter for one who really was
brooded among the spheres, and who accepted a
mother only as a necessary means to incarnation.  We
need accord no more than scant time to a mere mother.
</p>

<p>
There was in the character of the elder Rawn's wife
little to offset the tendencies transmitted by the father.
Had she herself been a trace further removed from
the blind submission of a jungle past in womanhood,
it might have been that the offspring of these two
had been accorded a better insight into the real
situation of mankind, might perhaps even have been given
a saving sense of humor, a better valuation of human
affairs as pertaining to himself, and of himself as
related to human affairs.  The truth, however, is that
Mrs. Rawn, the preacher's wife, was simply a preacher's
wife.  She was a machine for gratifying a certain
part of her husband's nature, a well-nigh apogamic
contrivance for rearing children, an appliance for
tending tables and sweeping carpets, and going to prayer
meetings, or perhaps&mdash;on rare and much-coveted
occasions&mdash;for acting as witness in parsonage marriage
ceremonies, the which might haply produce a fee from
the bridegroom, temporarily generous; which fee, in a
moment of aberration, might even pass from parson
to parson's wife.  It is decreed that the background of
a ministerial life shall be of neutral hue, in order that
the more brilliantly shall shine the central figure of the
scheme.  The minister himself, unctuous, bland, grows
less unctuous and bland as he turns from some comelier
sister to his own partner in life, colorless, silent,
dutiful, devoted.  There is but one family perihelion,
and he is the one planet thereat.  At most a pale and
distant moon may circle about him, perhaps concerned
with domestic tides, but not admittedly related to the
affairs of night and day.
</p>

<p>
It is not known, nor is it important, whence
Mrs. Rawn came, or how she happened to marry her lord,
John Rawn, Senior, the Methodist preacher in the little
Texas town.  They were married when they arrived at
this place, and had been for some years.  No one
knows whence they came, no man can tell whither they
have gone.  John was the first child granted to them
as answer to his father's grumbling; the latter, very
nobly and righteously, dreading what calamity the
world must suffer did none come to perpetuate his
race.  He was a great preacher.  He had swayed his
multitudes.  He had seen a hundred souls, as he
termed them, grovelling upon the floor in the height
of some revival when the grace of the Lord had moved
itself mightily upon the people, thanks to him, partner
upon the ground, whose voice had prevailed thereabout.
It would cause any just man to shudder&mdash;the mere
thought of such merit lacking progeny.  But the prayers
of the righteous avail much.  He had, at last, a son, our
hero; none less.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
These necessary and essential preliminaries now all
stand adjusted; and we are able finally to say that
John Rawn at least and at last was born, silently,
quietly, with small rebellion on the part of his mother.
He lay there in his first cradle, silent, a trifle red, a
slight frown upon his face, a trace of gravity in his
features, as he ventured an introspective look within
the confines of his couch, and for the first time
discovered that wholly interesting, remarkable, indeed
wonderful human being, Himself.
</p>

<p>
Having assured himself that he was here, John
Rawn sighed, turned over in his cradle, and presently
fell asleep, well assured that, although He had selected
Texas for this event, God after all was in His heaven,
and that, in the circumstance, all in due time would be
well with the world.  Could any hero of his years have
acted with a finer, a larger generosity?
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0103"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
IN VICTORY GENEROUS
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
The youth of John Rawn early began to show that
consistency in character which marked him later
in his life.  From the first, as we have said, he took
himself seriously; indeed, regarded himself with a
reverence akin almost to solemnity.  Plain wonder
possessed his soul when any event fell not wholly to his
liking.  If the hand that rocked his cradle failed from
weariness, his reproof was not so much that of anger
or expostulation as that of an aggrieved surprise.
When first he began to walk he gravely reserved to
himself the spotlight of all solar or sewing circles.
Ladies visiting the parsonage unconsciously accepted
his estimate of himself, even in those days.
Familiarities were not for such a child as this.  It began to
be rumored about that here was one set apart for great
things.  Most frequently parents are alone in this
manner of belief as to their offspring; but the severity
of countenance, the grave assuredness of young John
Rawn, forced this belief upon the entire community.
A calm, serene certainty of himself was written on
his brow.
</p>

<p>
Youth is for the most part irreverent of other youth,
that is true, and at times young Mr. Rawn was rudely
handled by others of his age.  In such cases tears came
to his eyes forsooth, but not tears of mere anger or
anguish.  They were tears of surprise, of regret, of
wonder!  His protest, when he fled to the comfort of
his mother's bosom, was not of unmanly weakness, but
of astonishment and incredulous surprise that any
should have smitten the Lord's anointed.  This
surprise for the most part prevented him either from
turning the other cheek, or smiting the cheek of the
oppressor; one or the other of which courses, it must be
admitted, commonly is held admirable among men, and
especially among heroes.
</p>

<p>
In his younger school-days there was a way about
young Mr. Rawn.  He did not really care for plodding,
yet he was aggrieved if not accorded rank among his
fellow pupils.  His spelling, not of the best in the
belief of others, seemed to him quite good enough,
because it was his own.  When sent to the foot of the
class he departed thither with a bearing wholly
dignified and calm.
</p>

<p>
Even in these early days his features were in large
mold, even then his abundant hair fell across his
brow.  His eyes were blue and prominent, his nose
distinct, his lower lip prominent, protruding and in
times of great emotion semi-pendulous.  Even thus
early he seemed old, serious, foreordained.  To tell a
being such as this that he could not spell was mere
<i>l√®se majest√©</i>.  He stalked through school, set apart by
fate from his fellow-beings, amenable to few rules,
superior to such restrictions as commonly hedge in lesser
souls orthographically, socially, or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Much of this might have been remedied by kindly
application of educational or parental rod, but young
Mr. Rawn remained largely unchastened.  His parents
did not care to punish him, and his teacher did not
dare to do so.  Was he not the minister's son?  If his
mother had misgivings they were well concealed.  She
herself only shuddered in her soul when she heard the
orotund voice of the master of the house explain, in
contemplation of his first born, "How much he is like
me!"  Yes, he was like.  His mother knew how like.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
At that time and in that part of the country this
little western village might have been called almost a
little world of itself.  Estimates of men and affairs
were such only as might grow out of the soil.  The
great world beyond was a thing but vaguely sensed of
any who dwelt here.  The town was apart from the
nearest railway, in a section where rural simplicity
amounted at times almost to frontier savagery.  Now
and then a lynching broke the quiet of the community.
The local vices and virtues came out of a life but
recently individual and unrestrained.  It seemed only
chance that young Rawn did not run wild, like many
other of the youth of that town, who, trained by
custom in arms and excess, disappeared from time to time,
passing on to the frontier, then not remote.
</p>

<p>
Why did not John Rawn naturally trend toward
violence, why did the frontier not call out to him?
There was one great reason&mdash;he was a coward.
</p>

<p>
Cowardice is a trait sometimes handed down from
father to son, indeed most usually it comes of heredity
or ill-health.  Sometimes it is fought down by reason,
sometimes it is long concealed by artifice.  Often it is
hidden behind physical stature.  Most frequently it is
left unsuspected, sheltered behind an air of dignity.
Money conceals much of it.  Young Rawn was much
like his father before him.  Perhaps his father never
had stopped to think that personal conclusions were
matters he had never been called upon to carry to an
end with any fellow-man.  Peter Cartwright was no
saint of his.  There was no need, in his belief, to put
spiritual or mental questions to the acid and unpleasant
test of physical contact.  The son, given by nature
a considerable stature and gravity for his years,
continued in the same fiction, not suspecting that it was
fiction.  There were larger boys than he, but chivalry
restrained these.  There were smaller boys than he,
but these feared him by reason of the valor which it
was supposed he owned.  The ranks of life opened
before him readily and easily.  He stalked forward,
with small opposition, accepted at his own estimate of
himself; as presently we shall set forth in many
valuable instances.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
It may be supposed that, in a rural community of
this sort, living was cut down pretty much to the bone
of actual necessities.  There was no excess of comfort,
and, although there was little lack, luxury was a thing
undreamed.  Transportation was in that day costly
and inefficient, the world not so small then as it is now,
so that there was less interchange of the products of
distant countries and localities.  For instance, there
were orange groves within three hundred miles of this
little village, yet rarely was an orange to be seen there.
Flour, salt, coffee, bacon, Bibles, six-shooters, essential
things, were carried thither, not luxuries and trifles.
The family was its own world.  In large part, it tilled
its own fields and ran its own factories.  Mrs. Rawn
molded the candles which made the bedroom lights
and those by which she sewed&mdash;though not that by
which her husband read and wrote&mdash;in a kettle in the
backyard at butchering times, when suet came the
parson's way.  She made her husband's long black coats,
building them upon some prehistoric pattern.  She
made, mended and washed his shirts, hemmed his
stocks and darned his socks for him.  Using the
outworn ministerial cloth in turn, she made also, in due
time, the garments of the son and heir, even building
for him a cap, with ear-lappets, for winter use.  Her
own garments might have been seen by the most
casual eye to have been the product of her own hands.
Yet, this home was not much different from others,
where countless things then were done domestically
which now are fabricated in factories and purchased
through many middlemen.  The lockstep of our
civilization was not then so fully in force.
</p>

<p>
Money was a rare commodity in any such community,
and any manner of personal indulgence was for
but few.  If, for instance, there was beef on the
parsonage table, it was the parson alone who ate it,
not his wife.  Once he came home with two lemons,
which had been given him, perhaps as a peace-offering,
by a generous storekeeper.  These he ordered made
forthwith into lemonade; the which, forthwith also, he
himself drank, offering none to the sharer of his joys;
nor did she find anything either unusual or
reproach-worthy in this act.  You wonder at these things?
They happened in another day, among people with
whom you could not be expected to be familiar&mdash;your
fathers and mothers; persons not in the least of our
class.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
In these circumstances&mdash;since we have promised
value in some specific instance&mdash;a certain interest
attaches to a little event which nowhere else, save in
some such village, would have been noted or could
have been possible.  The leading local merchant, in a
burst of enterprise, had imported a couple of clusters
of bananas from New Orleans, the first ever brought
into the town.  For a time none of the citizens
purchased, and, indeed, it required the grudging gift of
a banana or so to establish a local demand.
Then&mdash;builded on the assurance of a wise and much-traveled
citizen who had once eaten a banana at Fort Worth&mdash;the
rumor of the bananas passed rapidly through the
town.  Swiftly it became an important thing to
announce to a neighbor that one had eaten of this fruit.
In time, even children partook thereof.
</p>

<p>
At this time young Mr. Rawn was six years of age,
and by reason of his years and his social position at
least as much entitled to bananas as any of his like
thereabout.  Yet, he had none.  The tragedy of this
wrung his mother's soul.  Was it to be thought that
this, her son, should be denied any of the good things
of life, that he should have less than equal enjoyment
of life's privileges in the company of his fellows?  The
climax came when young Mr. Rawn himself approached
his mother's knee, with wonder and surprise
upon his face, inquiring why others had bananas, while
he himself, the Lord's anointed, and son of the Lord's
anointed, had none.  It was at that time that his
mother somewhat furtively stole away down the village
street.  She had a few coppers, saved by such hook
and crook as you and I may not know, and these she
now proposed to devote to a holy cause.
</p>

<p>
It was at about this same time, also, that there
chanced to pass by, on the sidewalk in front of the
parsonage, two boys younger than John Rawn himself.
These he regarded intently, for he saw from a distance
that each had some suspicious object in his hand.  His
own suspicions became certainties.  Here was visible
proof that they, mere common persons, were owners
of specimens of that fruit whose excellence was
rumored throughout the town.  They ate, or were about to
eat, while he did not!  They had luxuries while he had
none!  They had not asked his permission, yet they
ate!  Form this picture well in your mind, oh, gentle
reader.  It is that of John Rawn and ourselves.
</p>

<p>
With great gravity and dignity young Mr. Rawn
stalked down the brick walk to the front gate of the
parsonage yard.  Calmly, with no word, but with
uplifted hand&mdash;nay, merely by his stately dignity&mdash;he
barred the progress of these two.  They paused,
uncertain.  Then he held out his hand, and, with a growl
of command, demanded of these others that which
they had regarded as their own.  He took it as
matter of course that C√¶sar should have the things that
were C√¶sar's; and they who give tribute to our C√¶sars
now, gave it then.
</p>

<p>
Having possession of these bananas, which as yet
remained unbroken of their owners, young Mr. Rawn
showed them that, although these fruits were unfamiliar
to their former owners, they made no enigma to a
person of his powers.  As though he had done nothing
else all his life, he broke open the tender skin and
removed the soft interior contents.  After this he handed
back to each of his young friends the disrupted and
now empty skins.  Yet, with much kindness, he
explained to both that at the bottom of each husk or
envelope there still remained some portion of edible
contents which, with care upon their part, might yet
be rescued.  They departed, wondering somewhat, but
glad they had been shown how this thing was done;
even as you and I humbly thank our great men for
robbing us to-day.
</p>

<p>
Young Mr. Rawn, age six, turned now with much
dignity back to the gallery from which he had with
much dignity come.  He seated himself calmly upon
the chair and began to eat that which had been given
him of fate, that which had been brought to C√¶sar as
a thing due to C√¶sar.  He ate until at last, wearied
with his labors, he fell asleep.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Note now our humble moral in this short and simple
detail of our hero's early years.  He was at this
moment more nearly full of bananas than any other
human being in all the village at that time.  Yet he
had attained that success at no price save that of the
exercise of the resources of his mind.  That is genius.
Let us not smile at young Mr. Rawn.
</p>

<p>
His mother, stealing home by the back way with
yet other bananas concealed in her apron, presently
came upon him and discovered that, after all, her
solicitude had not been, needful.  Her son slept, his lower
lip protruding, his features grave, his legs somewhat
sprawled apart, his mid-body somewhat distended, his
head sunken forward, his hands drooping at his side.
In one hand, clutched so tightly as to have become a
somewhat worthless pulp, his mother discovered the
bulk of several bananas; in short, the full quota which
had been assigned to two of his fellow-beings.  It was
genius!
</p>

<p>
Even at that time there departed up the village
street those which had given tribute to C√¶sar.  They
regarded with a certain curiosity the empty husks which
had been returned to them&mdash;even as you and I regard
the husks accorded us by overgreat men to-day.  From
time to time each nibbled, with small return, although
as per instructions, at the base from which the main
fruit had been broken.  Witness the difference among
men.  These had bananas for which something had
been paid.  John Rawn had many, better and bigger
bananas, for which nothing at all had been paid!  In
return for them he had shown their late owners how
to open a banana.  For the later opening of that which
in our parlance we call the melon, John Rawn was now
decently under way.  Already he was showing
himself to be a captain among men.
</p>

<p>
His mother looked upon him as he slept sprawled
in his repletion and made no attempt to remove the
uneaten fruit from his hands; indeed, made no query as
to where he had obtained it.  She did not disturb his
slumbers.  "How like his father he is!" she whispered
to herself, mindful of certain lemons, certain
beefsteaks, certain wedding fees, certain gone and wasted
years.  She did not say: "How dear he is, how sweet,
how manly, how brave, how decent, how chivalrous!"  No,
with a slight tightening of the lips as she turned
back to find her belated sewing, she spoke, as though to
herself, and with no peculiar glorying in her voice,
"How like he is to his father!"   And so took up her
burden.

CHAPTER IV
<br />
IN LOVE SUCCESSFUL
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear&mdash;but Laura, you don't stop to
think!" exclaimed a certain young man to a
certain young woman, at a somewhat interesting and
important moment of their lives.  "You certainly do
not mean to say&mdash;to tell me&mdash;to tell me!  Why&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
He ceased, a gasp in his throat at the unbelievable
effrontery of the woman who faced him in this situation.
All he had asked of her was to marry him.  And
she had hesitated.  It was a thing incredible!
</p>

<p>
It was Mr. Rawn, our hero.  It could have been
almost no one else who could have sustained precisely
this attitude at precisely such a time.  It was not
despair, disappointment, anger, chagrin, pique, regret or
resentment that marked his tones, but surprise,
astonishment!  Yes, it must have been John Rawn.
</p>

<p>
As to the young woman herself, who now turned a
somewhat pale face to one side as she left her hand in
his, she might have been any one of many thousand
others in that city.  Her hair was brown, her features
regular enough, her complexion nondescript, her garb
non-committal.  Not a person of ancient lineage, you
would have said, or of much education in the world's
ways, or of much worldly goods&mdash;these things do not
always come to a saleswoman of twenty-five, whose
salary is six dollars a week.  Yet her face had in it
now a very sweet sort of womanliness, her mouth a
tender droop to it.  Her eyes shone with that look
which comes to a woman's eyes when first she hears
the declaration of man's love&mdash;the most glorious and
most tragic moment in all a woman's life.
</p>

<p>
The fates ordain which of these it shall be&mdash;glory
or tragedy.  Laura Johnson could not tell, cry in her
soul as she might for some forecast shadow from the
land of fates to show, visibly, upon the subconscious
screen hidden in a girl's heart, the figure of the truth.
All this was different from what she had pictured it
to be.  She had thought that love would come in some
tender yet imperious way, that she would know some
sudden wave of content and trust and assuredness.
There was on her plain, severe face, now a wistfulness
that almost glorified it after all.  For, indeed, our
human loving is most dignified and glorious in what it
desires love to be.
</p>

<p>
He leaned again toward her, insistent, frowning,
imperious.  This was as she had planned.  What, then,
lacked?  If she had sought for some strong man to
sweep her from her calm, why was she now so calm?
She asked this swiftly, vaguely, wonderingly, demanding
to be told by these same fates which had implanted
doubt in her heart, whether this was all that she might
ever hope, whether this insufficient fashion was the
way in which it came to all women&mdash;had come, always,
to all the women of the world.
</p>

<p>
"You surely do not stop to consider," he renewed.
"Why, look at me!"
</p>

<p>
She did look at him, turning about, pushing him
away from her that she might, in that one moment of
a woman's privilege, look at the being demanding of
her her own life.  What she saw was not an ill-looking
young man of twenty-nine, of rather heavy features,
rather a frowning brow, a somewhat prominent light
eye, a somewhat pendulous lower lip, abundant darkish
hair, abundant confidence in himself.  He was tallish,
well built, strong, seemed somewhat of a man,
yes.  And he loved her.  At least he had said he did.
</p>

<p>
Laura Johnson did stop to consider.  She considered
the face which she saw in the glass beyond his
shoulder&mdash;her own face, not strikingly handsome.  "I might
be any one of a hundred girls," she said to herself.  "I
might be any one of those other hundreds who might
be sought out instead of myself," said she.  "A girl
of my looks and place in life is not apt to have
hundreds of opportunities.  And I am tired, and puzzled.
And I want a home.  I want to stop worrying for
myself.  I would rather worry for some one else.  I want
to be&mdash;"  There she paused.
</p>

<p>
She wanted to be a wife, loved, cherished, supported,
comforted and protected.  That was what she wanted,
though the young of the female sex do not know what
they want or why they want it.  And certainly she
could choose only among the opportunities offered her.
This was her first opportunity.  It might be her last.
Besides all of this, she was a woman.  She had always
obeyed men all her life, at home, in her daily labors,
everywhere.  And this man was so insistent, so assured,
so confident that this was the right and inevitable
course for her&mdash;why, he said it again and again&mdash;that
surely&mdash;so she reasoned&mdash;she must be crazed not to see
that this was the appointed time, that this was the
appointed man.
</p>

<p>
She sighed a trifle as she laid aside the garment of
her girlhood, which had kept her sweet and clean for
five and twenty years.  She folded both her worn and
rather bony hands, put them both in his, and said, with
a little smile that ought to have wrung his heart, "Well,
John, if&mdash;if it must be!"
</p>

<p>
He did not catch the little sob in her voice.  He
never knew, either then or at any other time in his
life, what it was that lacked in her voice, her face, in
her heart, indeed.  He never knew, then or at any other
time, what a woman is, what she covets, longs for,
craves, desires, demands, requires passionately, prizes
agonizingly to the last, the very last.  He did not waste
time to query over these unimportant things.  He
drew her to him with rude care, kissed her fair and
full, and then rose.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I'm sure we're going to do well together,
Laura, dear."
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, but sat waiting, longing eagerly
for something she lacked, she knew not what.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn looked at his watch, turned for his hat,
and remarked, "I'll be here to-morrow night, dear, at
half-past seven.  Right after supper."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Our hero, John Rawn, had grown up much as he
was planned to be.  Since we have been liberal in
regard to his genesis before he arrived in the little Texas
town, let us be niggardly as to his exodus therefrom,
for that is less in importance.  It may be seen that
he has grown, through what commonplace conditions
let us not ask.  As he himself never stopped to think,
after his arrival in St. Louis to seek his fortune,
whether or not his parents still were living, we
ourselves need ask no more than he.  Since he by now had
well-nigh forgotten the scenes of his youth, so may
we forget them.  He had come to this northern city to
seek his fortune.  Here was a part of it, as he coolly
reasoned.  What is especially worth noting is that he still
mentioned his evening meal as supper&mdash;and not as
dinner.
</p>

<p>
These twain, about to be one flesh, as witness their
sober speech, both ate supper, and not dinner, and had
done so most of their lives.  They came out of middle
class circumstances, very similar in each case.  Their
lives had been much similar.  They both had come to
the city to seek their fortunes.  She had found hers
behind a dry-goods counter, he his&mdash;temporarily and
in sufferance, of course&mdash;as an ill-paid clerk in a
railway office.  They met now and then as they passed out
for luncheon, met betimes at evening as they started
home.  For a time they met also in the same boarding
place, where they had rooms not far apart.  It was
perhaps propinquity that did it.  When this thought
came to Laura Johnson, with her first realization that
perhaps this young man was making love to her, or
was apt to do so, she changed her boarding place at
once, actuated by some indefinable feeling of delicacy.
She wanted to see if there were no better reason for
love-making than that of mere propinquity.  But he
had followed; and she was pleased at that, almost to
the point of ascribing to herself some charm which she
herself had not suspected.  He came again and again,
daily, each night after supper, as he had said, in fact.
She did not deny that she had made all pleasant for
him to the best of her ability.  And now he was going
to come again, after the next supper; only in a
different r√¥le, that of her accepted suitor.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
That was almost all there was about it.  What would
you expect of two ill-paid clerks, twenty-nine and
twenty-five years of age?  What might they have to
hope for, more than for each other?  Why should the
ambition of either leap beyond what was there present,
in its own comprehensible world?  Why should they
not keep on meeting day after day, after supper?
</p>

<p>
Romance is by no means a necessary thing.  The
truly necessary thing is supper.  John Rawn knew
this.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
IN ADVERSITY TRIUMPHANT
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
It might with some justice be urged that, thus far
in his life, Mr. Rawn has shown little to distinguish
him from his fellow-men; that indeed his career has
been commonplace almost to the point of lack of
interest to others.  There are many of us who have been
born in this or that small community, who have lived
somewhat humdrum lives, have married in a somewhat
humdrum way, and who have, in like unspectacular
fashion, failed to achieve any distinguished success in
affairs.  Yet, did we restrict ourselves to this point of
view, we must fail of our purpose herein, just as
Mr. Rawn himself would have failed had he allowed
himself no imagination in his view of himself.  For the
man who is commonplace and who is aware of the
fact, the future is apt to have but little hope, nor is
his story apt to hold any interest.  In the case of
Mr. Rawn the reverse of this was true.  He did not rate
himself as commonplace.  Always he pictured himself
as central figure in some large scene presently to be
staged.  His life was much like ours, and ours are for
the most part of small concern to others.  But John
Rawn heard Voices.  They spoke of himself.  He saw
a Vision.  It was of himself.  The trouble with us
others is that we bashfully still the voices and timidly
wipe the image from our mirrors.  Let us pass all
these matters with reference to them as small as was
Rawn's own.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn, then, married Laura Johnson, and they
lived unhappily ever after.  That is to say, she did.  As
for her lord, he did not notice his wife to any great
extent after once they had settled down together, but
came to regard her as one of those incidents of life
which classify with food, clothing, the need of sleep.
He looked upon his wife much as he did upon the
weather.  Both happened, and both for the most part
were to be condemned.  Still, he took no active
measures for the abolishment of either.
</p>

<p>
He was a solemn man in his home, or at least for the
most part a silent.  Yet at times he became almost
cheerful&mdash;when the talk fell upon himself; indeed, he
would explain to his wife, with much care and elaboration,
himself, his character, his virtues and his plans.
In his household life he kept up the traditions in which
he had been reared.  He ate all the beefsteak there was
on the table when there was but enough for one,
which latter often was the case, for his wife had need to
be frugal.  At times he would purchase a solitary ticket
to the theater and go alone.  Yet he was generous, and
always after his return home he would with fine
feeling tell his wife what he had seen.  Sometimes he spent
a Sunday in the country, but, as he himself had been
first to state, he was never selfish about this.  He
always would tell his wife how green the grass had been,
how sweet the songs of the birds, how bright the sky.
Most of all he would tell of the song of one small bird
which sang continually in his ear, telling him of a
success which before long, in some way, was to be their
own.  The passing years left his wife a trifle thinner,
a trifle more gray.  He himself continued fresh, stalwart,
strong.  Sometimes, coming back from the theater
or the country, after listening to the voice of this
small bird at his ear, he would smite with a heavy fist
upon the family table and say, "Why, Laura, look at
me&mdash;look at me!"  After which a heavy frown would
come upon his face as of one conscious of tardiness in
the fashion of fate.  But he knew that he was a
great man.

Now, what Laura, his wife, knew is not for us to
say.  She held her peace.  Never a word of complaint,
or taunt, or reproach, or of longing came to her lips.
Never did she repine at the situation of life which held
them for more than a dozen years after they were
married&mdash;one of perpetual monotony, of narrow,
iron-bound restraint.  After some incredible, some
miraculous way of womankind, she managed to make the
ends meet, indeed even to overlap a trifle at each
week-end.  She smiled in the morning when he went
away, smiled in the evening when he returned, and if
meanwhile she did not smile again throughout all the
day, at least she did her part.  A great soul, this of
Laura Rawn; but no greater than that of many another
woman who does these things day after day until the
time comes for the grave, wherein she lies down at last
with equanimity and calm.  Without unduly flattering
the vanity, without overfeeding the egotism of her lord
and master, at least Laura Rawn was wise enough to
see he could not be much changed.  Finding herself
thus situated, she accepted her case and spent her time
doing what could be done, not wasting it in seeking the
impossible.  He was her husband, that was all.  She
knew no better way of life than to accept that fact
and make the most of it.  Which is tragedy, if you
please.

</p>

<p>
After the birth of Grace Rawn, their daughter, which
occurred within the first year of their wedded life,
Laura Rawn had something to interest her for the
remainder of their days.  Her horizon widened now
immeasurably; indeed to the extent of giving her a
world of her own wherein she could dwell apart quite
comfortably; one in which her husband had no part.
Simple and just in her way of thought, she accepted
the truth that without married life, without her
husband, this new world could not have been her own.
Wherefore she credited him, and in her child,
somewhat reverenced him.  She was an old-fashioned wife.
</p>

<p>
As to the child herself, she grew steadily and
normally into young girlhood, in time into young
womanhood, not given to much display, reserved of judgment
as well as of speech, ofttimes sullen in mood, yet withal
a step or so higher than her mother on the ladder of
feminine charm.  She had a clean, good family rearing,
and a good grammar school education.  At about
the time her father came to be a man of middle age,
Grace fell into her place in the clerical machine of the
railway office where he worked; for very naturally,
being an American girl of small means, she took up
shorthand, and was licensed to do violence.  At home
she joined her mother in regard and attention for the
master of the house.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Here, then, was simply a good, middle-class American
family, offering for some years little to attract the
attention of those who dwelt about them.  The head
of this family, as he attained additional solidity of
figure, grew even heavier of brow, trod with even more
stateliness about his appointed duties.  It was a
privilege for the other clerks who labored near him to see
such calm, such dignity.  On the street John Rawn
asked no pardons if he brushed against his fellow-man.
In his business life, in his conduct upon the
street-car, at the restaurant table, anywhere, he helped
himself as though of right, and regarded the rights
or preferences of others not at all.  The community
cream, the individual butter, he accumulated unto
himself unsmilingly, as once he had bananas in his youth.
Broad hints, deprecating smiles, annoyed protests, all
were lost upon him.  At forty-seven years of age his
salary was but one hundred and twenty-five dollars a
month.  That showed only the lack of wisdom of
others, not unfitness in himself.  Had this been Greece,
or Rome, or medi√¶val England, he would have shown
them who was entitled to the throne!  Indeed, he
would show them that yet.  He often told his wife and
daughter as much.
</p>

<p>
Did we not know the genesis of Mr. Rawn, and did
we not know full well the divine right of kings, we
might call this rather a curious frame of mind for a
man who dwelt in a small house with green blinds and
a dingy back yard, for whose conjoint charms he paid
but twenty dollars a month, on whose floors there was
much efflorescence of art square, upon whose
be-lambrequined mantels showed few works of art beyond
a series of bisque shepherdesses and china dogs, on
whose parlor table reclined a Dying Gaul, and on
whose boudoir walls hung an engraving of the Rock
of Ages.  But John Rawn bided his time.  He went
on year after year, grave and dignified, perhaps one
new cross wrinkle coming in his forehead with each
Christmas, recorded by one more annual shepherdess
upon the family mantel.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
And yet all this time success was lying in ambush,
as it sometimes does, ready to spring forth at the
appointed hour.  At about this time there occurred
changes in the arrangement of the planets, the
juxtaposition of the spheres, which meant great alteration
in the affairs of John Rawn, of Kelly Row, who dwelt
in a brick house six miles out from the railway office
where he had worked for twenty-four years, and where
he had risen in so brief a time all the way from forty
to one hundred and twenty-five dollars per month.
</p>

<p>
Let us dwell upon the picture for a moment, deliriously.
Could it be possible that this man in time would
own a large part of this railway and of others?  Was
it possible to predict a day when an army of clerks and
others, here or there, would stand ready to jump when
Rawn cracked over them a whip whose handle well
fitted in his hand?  Could the time be predicted,
dreamed, imagined, when the president of this road,
the great Henry Warfield Standley, would spring to
open the door for John Rawn, twenty-four years a
clerk, of whose existence he had not long known?
</p>

<p>
Yet all these things actually did occur.  They could
occur only in America; but this is America.  They
could occur only at the summons of a megalomaniac
selfishness, an inordinate lust of power; but here were
these, biding their time, in the seriously assured mind
of an American man; a man after all born of his age
and of his country, and representative of that
country's typical ambition&mdash;the ambition for a material
success.
</p>

<p>
The lust of power&mdash;that was it!  The promise of
power&mdash;that was what the small bird had sung in John
Rawn's ear!  The craving and coveting of power&mdash;that
was what quivered in the marrow of his bones,
that put ponderousness in his tread, that shone out of
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
It was this, it was all of these, focused suddenly and
unexpectedly by the lens of accident into a burning
point of certainty, which marked the air and attitude
of John Rawn one evening on his return to his home
at the conclusion of his day's work.  He almost
stumbled as he entered the door, heedless of the threshold.
He paced up and down the narrow little hall, trod here
and there almost as in a trance, muttering to himself,
before at last he stood in front of his wife and spread
out his arms&mdash;not for her, but for the imaginary
multitude whom he addressed in her.
</p>

<p>
"Laura," said he, "Laura, it's come!  I've got the
idea.  It's going to win.  We're going to be rich.  I've
believed it all along, and I know it now!  Laura, look
at me&mdash;didn't I always tell you so&mdash;didn't I know?"
</p>

<p>
He stood before her, his shoulders back, his chin
up, his brow frowning, his lips trembling in simple,
devout admiration of himself.  It was not defiance that
marked his attitude.  John Rawn did not defy the
lightning.  He only wondered why the lightning had
so long defied him.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
MR. RAWN ANNOUNCES HIS ARRIVAL
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
For some time Mrs. Rawn said nothing in answer
to her husband's declaration.  She had known
such things before.  Indeed, with woman's instinct for
deliberate self-deception, she sometimes in spite of her
own clear-sightedness had persuaded herself to feel a
sort of resentment at the conditions which so long had
held her husband back; had been sure, as so many
wives are, that only a conspiracy of injustice had
thwarted him of success.  If only he could get his
chance!  That was the way she phrased it, as most
wives do&mdash;and most husbands.
</p>

<p>
But to-day there was something so sincere in his air
as to take her beyond her own forced insincerity with
herself.  She caught conviction from his tone.  There
fell this time upon the sensitized plate of her woman's
nature some sort of shadow of events to come which
left there a permanent imprint as of the truth.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, John?" she demanded.  Her eye kindled,
her voice had in it something not of forced or perfunctory
interest.  He caught these also, in his exalted
mood almost as sensitive as herself.
</p>

<p>
"Then you believe it at last!" he demanded, almost
fiercely.  It was the voice of his father speaking,
demanding of a sinner whether or not she had repented
of her former fallen state.  "You begin to think that
after all I'll do something for us both?  Oh, well, I'm
glad&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, John, I always thought so," she eluded mildly.
"When did I ever&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know that you ever said it in so many
words," he grumbled, "but of course I knew how you
felt about it.  I suppose a woman can't help that.  It
was my part to succeed somehow, some time, in spite
of you.  I always knew I would."
</p>

<p>
He paced up and down, his coat tails back of the
hands which he thrust deep into his pockets.  "I'll tell
you again, since I have never spoken of this&mdash;for fear
you'd think me just a little conceited about myself"&mdash;he
smiled in a manner of deprecation, never for an
instant catching the comedy of this, more than she
herself displayed proof of her own wish to smile&mdash;"I'll
tell you anyhow, though you may think I've got a bit
of vanity about myself.  The truth is, I've always
believed in myself, Laura!  I've kept it hidden, of
course&mdash;never let a soul know that I thought myself the least
bit different from anybody else.  <i>You</i> didn't know it,
even&mdash;and you're my wife.  I've been considered a
modest man all, my life.  Yet, Laura, here's the truth
about it&mdash;I <i>wasn't</i>, really!  I <i>did</i> feel different from
other men.  I didn't feel just like an ordinary man.  I
<i>knew</i> I was not&mdash;and there's the truth about it.  I
don't know exactly how to tell you, but I've always
known, as sure as anything, that some day I'd be a
rich man."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
She sat looking at him seriously, her elbows resting
on the table, her gray eyes following him as he walked,
his face serious, the imperious lock of hair now fallen
across his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I would let money itself be the only thing,
my dear, as you know," he went on nobly.  "I wouldn't
do that.  Any man worth while has larger ambitions
than merely making money.  After I've made money
enough, for us&mdash;more than you ever dreamed about&mdash;after
I've succeeded and proved myself&mdash;then I'm going
to do something for other men&mdash;my inferiors in
life, you know&mdash;the laboring men.  I suppose, after
all, people are pretty much alike in some ways.  Some
men are stronger than others, more fit to succeed; but
they ought to remember that after all they are the
agents of Providence, that they are custodians, Laura,
custodians.  No man, Laura, no matter what his
success, ought to be wholly selfish.  He oughtn't to
be&mdash;well, conceited about himself, you know.  He ought to
be <i>humble</i>."
</p>

<p>
She still looked after him, wondering whether, after
all, he might not be a trifle off his head; but the
seriousness of his eye daunted her.
</p>

<p>
"As for us, we'll move up to Chicago first, in all
likelihood; maybe later to New York, for I suppose
business will take us there a great deal of the time.
As to where we'll make our home eventually, I hardly
know.  Sometimes I think we'll come back here and
build a real house, just to show these people who we
were all the time.  Wherever we build, we'll furnish,
too.  I'm going to be a spender.  Oh, I've <i>longed</i> for
it all my life&mdash;the feel of money going out between my
fingers!  Not all for ourselves, mind you.  Maybe you
don't quite understand about that&mdash;I couldn't expect
you to.  But after I've done something for the common
people, I want to <i>build</i> something&mdash;churches, monuments,
something that will stick and stay after you and
I are gone, and tell them who John Rawn was.  I
want them to say, most of all, that he was a <i>modest</i>
man, that he was a kind man, and not a selfish
one&mdash;not a <i>selfish</i> man, Laura."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
She nodded, looking at him fixedly, large-natured
enough to be just in the assembling of these crude and
unformulated ambitions which she knew tormented
him.  "Yes, John," she said quietly.
</p>

<p>
The next instant his mood changed.
</p>

<p>
"But one thing they'll have to do!" he said, smiting
a fist into his palm.  "They'll have to admit that I <i>was</i>
John Rawn!  They'll have to realize that success comes
where it belongs.  <i>My</i> brain, <i>my</i> energy, <i>my</i> point of
view, <i>my</i> ability to command men, <i>my</i> instinct for
leadership&mdash;they'll have to recognize all that.  I'll
make them see who we were all the time.  Why, Laura,
we've just been walking along a flat floor, more than
twenty years, and now we're going to take the
elevator.  We'll go <i>up</i> now, straight and fast.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to make you happy now," he mused.
"You've been a good enough wife.  I always said that
to myself&mdash;'She's been a good wife.'  I'm going to
show you that you didn't make any mistake that night
when you took me, only a railway clerk, with a salary
of forty a month."
</p>

<p>
She did not remind him that, so far as she knew, he
was still a railway clerk, with a salary which in twenty
years had not grown abnormally.  But now her own
ambitions began to vault: first of all, the ambition of a
mother for her child.  She accepted all these vague
statements as convincing truths; for where we hope
we are easily convinced.
</p>

<p>
"But how soon, John?  You see, there is Grace, our
girl."
</p>

<p>
"She'll wear diamonds and real clothes."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't thinking of that.  I was thinking of her
education.  Grace ought to go to some good girls'
college in the East.  You see, you and I didn't have so
very much education, John," she smiled.
</p>

<p>
He frowned in answer.  "We didn't need so much,
so far as that goes.  Books are not everything.  There's
plenty of college men who don't amount to anything."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't so much mean books.  But you see, John,
we've lived rather carelessly.  We've not been very
conventional, we don't know very many people,
and&mdash;maybe&mdash;we don't know much how things are <i>done</i>, you
see.  Now suppose we were giving a dinner, and you
had to take out the guest of honor&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  I reckon any guest'd feel honored
enough to come to my house.  I'm not worrying about
that.  Cash in the bank is the main thing for the guest
of honor.  As for the girl, she'll have as much
education as we had, and that's enough."
</p>

<p>
"But I want her to be a lady, John."
</p>

<p>
"Can't she be?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll want her to marry well, John."
</p>

<p>
"Won't she?  If she has money, can't she?"
</p>

<p>
"But I want her to be prized for herself, for what
she is."
</p>

<p>
"She'll be our daughter, and won't that be enough?"
</p>

<p>
"But herself!"
</p>

<p>
"She's our girl.  I don't see where she'd find better
parents."
</p>

<p>
"I was just thinking&mdash;about her education&mdash;that a
little finishing would help her.  We wouldn't always
live just as we are living now, and she ought to be
prepared for better things.  We read about things, but
what do we know about them?  Grace ought to know."
</p>

<p>
"I don't really join in your anxiety, Mrs. Rawn,"
said he largely, "but that'll all come, if it's needful."
</p>

<p>
"It's needful now.  Grace'll be a young woman
before long.  You see&mdash;" she flushed painfully as she
spoke&mdash;"I don't want to see her grow up awkward.
I don't want her to feel as though she hadn't been used
to things, you know&mdash;to be ashamed of herself and
her&mdash;her parents.  Not that I care so much for myself&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There were tears in her eyes&mdash;tears of reaction, of
hope however badly founded.  She had toiled long and
patiently.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what's the matter, Laura?" asked her husband.
</p>

<p>
"I'm getting to be almost old, John&mdash;I'm almost an
old lady now!  I've got gray hairs.  I'm forty-five."
</p>

<p>
He shook her by the shoulders playfully.  "Nonsense!
We're almost of an age, and I'm just beginning
life.  Grace is only a child."
</p>

<p>
"She's eighteen past.  That's why I asked you how
soon&mdash;tell me, have they really raised your salary,
John?  If we could only have two thousand dollars a
year it would be all in the world I should ask."
</p>

<p>
"Salary!" he guffawed.  "Two thousand dollars a
year!  Say that much a month, a week, a day!"
</p>

<p>
"You're crazy, John!  What do you mean?"  Indeed,
some doubt of his sanity now began to enter
her mind.
</p>

<p>
"Read in the papers about the daily incomes of those
big chaps, those really great men back East, the fellows
who run things.  Every one of them made it out of
nothing&mdash;not one of them had any one to give him a
start.  We've no right to say that I can't do as well
as they have.  The start's the thing."
</p>

<p>
"But what has happened, then?  I never saw you so
stirred up before in all my life, John."
</p>

<p>
"I never have been."
</p>

<p>
"But what is sure&mdash;what can I depend on for
Grace?"
</p>

<p>
"Death, taxes, and a woman's curiosity are all the
sure things.  I don't know anything else that is sure.
No man can give all the details of his life in
advance."
</p>

<p>
"In advance?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it hasn't all actually happened yet, of course.
I won't begin wheeling home a wheelbarrow full of
gold every night for quite a while.  But some day I
may!"  His lips closed grimly.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"Grace'll be a young woman before long," his wife
still mused, irrelevantly.
</p>

<p>
"Let that take care of itself.  I'll deliver the goods."
</p>

<p>
She allowed herself a smile.  "They are not delivered?"
</p>

<p>
He flushed at this.  "You think they never will be?
Very well, I'll fight it out alone.  At least I believe in
myself."
</p>

<p>
"But what's <i>happened</i>?  What do you mean, after
all?"  She put her hand upon his arm as he passed.
He flung himself into a chair opposite her, his own
elbows on the table as he faced her.
</p>

<p>
"You can't understand it, Laura; but listen.  There
are two ways of getting rich.  You can make money
without brains in real estate, other people building you
up rich.  That's luck, not brains.  A great many of the
great fortunes&mdash;take Astor's, for instance, in New
York&mdash;have been made in that way.  But that's a
fortune which you O.K. after it's made, and you don't
know anything about it in advance&mdash;it's too far in the
future.  You don't hear of the ones that are not made.
Astor used his best judgment and bought land up the
island, where he thought people would go, but he
didn't know they'd go there.  That's as much luck as
brains.  We call luck brains when it makes good.
</p>

<p>
"But there's another way of getting rich.  That
means real <i>brains</i>, and not luck.  It means deliberately
figuring out what people are going to do.  There is
only so much room on the surface of the earth.  But
there's room in the air for millions and millions of
basic ideas."
</p>

<p>
He gloomed across at her, but she kindled, as ready
as ever to travel with his thought.
</p>

<p>
"Look at a few of the big ideas which have paid,"
he said.  "Give the people something they haven't had;
get them so they have to have it!  Cinch it first, and
sell it afterward&mdash;and you're going to get rich.
Granted an idea which takes hold on the daily life of
the whole people, and there's no way of measuring the
money you can make.
</p>

<p>
"For instance, you couldn't put the world back to
the place where it could get along without refined oil,
without steam and electric transportation, and the
telephone, and a thousand other things which have made
men rich&mdash;inventions which seemed little at first, but
which were universal after a while.  Oil, water, iron,
wood, steel&mdash;we have to have those things.  Cinch
them and sell them.  That's the way to get rich, my
dear.  Get an idea, get to it first, and cinch it for your
own.  Then sell it.  Keep on selling it.  Give 'em
something they've got to have, after showing 'em they've
got to have it.  Teach 'em what they ought to have
known without any teaching.  Some men teach and
others pay them for it.  After that, all you've got to do
is to take it away from them.  When you've taken away
enough, make 'em crawl&mdash;make 'em <i>admit</i> that you
were greater than they were.  Then build your
monument and make them keep on remembering you.  After
that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And after <i>that</i>, John?" she said gently.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
He did not hear her.  He sat staring, as though in
the mirror of his own mind.  At last he let his hand
drop across the table.  She dropped her own into his,
timidly.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Laura," he went on.  "I'll tell you a little
of what I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, John, I'm sure you will."
</p>

<p>
"What's the distinguishing thing about life to-day,
my dear&mdash;the thing that makes it different from that
of the past?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"A great many don't know.  They don't stop to
<i>think</i>!  That's why so many pass by the open door of
success and never get inside.  Listen, Laura.  Wait a
minute&mdash;don't interrupt me.  <i>Speed</i> is the thing
to-day.  Speed, speed, speed; and power!  Don't you see
it all around you, don't you feel it?  Can't you almost
smell it, touch it, taste it?  It's on the street, in the
house, in business, everywhere&mdash;we can't go fast
enough.  But we're going faster.  We'll go twice as
fast."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?  What do you mean?  Who
told you, John?"
</p>

<p>
"That's my business.  That's my idea.  That's my
invention.  That's how I'm going to get rich.
</p>

<p>
"Laura, I'm going to make it possible to gear up our
national life, to double its present speed," he went on
savagely.
</p>

<p>
"When they've got it, they'll think they always had
it, and after that they all will always have to have it.
I'll be there first.  I'll cinch it, and I'll sell it.  That's
my idea.  That's not luck.  It's brains, brains, <i>brains</i>,
Laura!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
She leaned back in her chair, sighing.  "Do you
think I could have a silk dress, John?" she said at
length, her mind overleaping vast intermediate details.
</p>

<p>
"My God, woman!"
</p>

<p>
"Could we go to the theaters&mdash;I've always wanted
to so much.  Could I go into the country once in a
while, where things are green?"
</p>

<p>
He made a despairing gesture at her inability to
grasp the future.
</p>

<p>
"We could travel&mdash;could we go over to Europe&mdash;could
we take Grace there, John?"
</p>

<p>
"As often as you liked!"
</p>

<p>
"Could we have a new gate in the picket fence, if
the landlord still refused?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God!"
</p>

<p>
She sat, trying to rise to the pitch of such ambition,
but succeeded only in remaining commonplace.  "How
did you come across it, John?" she asked after a little.
</p>

<p>
He smiled.  "What did I say about death and taxes
and a woman's curiosity?  The truth is, I picked it up
from a word or so I heard in a chance conversation&mdash;two
young fellows from the engineering department
were talking something over.  That young chap named
Halsey, just out of some college, full of fads, you
know.  He'd been reading something his old professor
had been monkeying over.  I got my idea then&mdash;the
idea of making any automobile go twice as fast as it
does, any railway train, anything else&mdash;of cutting out
a lot of useless human labor, and setting the power of
gravitation to work."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you said this was your own idea?"
</p>

<p>
"It <i>is</i> my own.  What is thrown away deliberately,
and picked up, is mine, if I see the value in it.  Young
Halsey didn't know.  He's just a visionary&mdash;nothing
practical about him.  He couldn't see into this."
</p>

<p>
"Halsey&mdash;Charley Halsey of the offices?  He's been
here&mdash;I think Grace&mdash;you see, the Personal Injury
office, where she works, is just across the hall from the
Engineering&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's no difference.  I'm going to take care of
the affair myself.  But it might be just as well if he
came, once in a while.  Grace might do worse."
</p>

<p>
"But you heard him speak of it first?"
</p>

<p>
"I've just told you, yes, woman!  But there was
nothing worked out.  I've got to furnish the time and
money and brains and the plan of working it out.  I've
never said a word to him yet, of course, and I don't
want you to say a word."
</p>

<p>
Her face fell.  "I'm afraid I can't understand all
these things, John.  But I should think you'd take
Charley in as a partner.  That is, if Grace&mdash;  Maybe
he could help."
</p>

<p>
"A partner?  With me?  Laura, John Rawn has no
partners."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
She rose after a time, her eyes not seeking his.
</p>

<p>
"Grace will be coming home directly," she said
briskly.  "I must get supper ready."
</p>

<p>
"One thing"&mdash;he raised a restraining hand&mdash;"keep
quiet about this.  I've told you too much already."
</p>

<p>
For half an instant Laura Rawn almost wondered
whether this thing might not be true.  Such things
had happened in this country.  Was there not daily
proof before her eyes?  And might not fortune reverse
her wheel for them also; might not lightning choose,
as sometimes elsewhere it had chosen, a humble and
unimportant spot for its alighting?  Who can read
the plans of the immortal gods? asked the pagans of
old.  Who, asked Laura Rawn, devout Christian, can
foresee the plans of a Divine Providence?
</p>

<p>
As for John Rawn, he troubled but little over the
immortal gods or over a Divine Providence, feeling
small need of the aid of either.  He had himself.

CHAPTER VII
<br />
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Thus far, the Rawn planet had moved but in
restricted orbit, to wit: one bounded as to one
extremity by the dingy yard and narrow walls of a home
rented at twenty dollars a month; at the other, by the
still dingier and more prosaic business surroundings
of a railway's general offices.  Narrow and dull enough
the Rawn life had been, and in such a life, lived on into
middle age, you scarce could have blamed a man had
he settled back for ever into the grip of the upreaching
fingers of monotony.  The half mechanical and parrot-like
repetition of set phrases in a restricted line of business
correspondence for Rawn himself, day after day;
the dull and endless round of homekeeping duties for
the wife&mdash;what but narrowness and dullness could
come out of life such as this?  Wherefore you should
not have been surprised had you been told that Grace
Rawn was simply the outgrowth of this sort of home,
this sort of life, not much different from other girls of
her class.
</p>

<p>
We are coming more and more in America to use
that word "class."  The theory is that we came to this
continent to escape class; but surely class has followed
us, and restricted us, and counted us out into elect
and damned, into those above and those below the salt.
Rather let us say the truth, which is that class has
followed us because we ourselves have followed after
class.
</p>

<p>
But continually the great laws of survival go on
after their own fashion.  In the production of human
beings there continually are at work the five laws of
evolution, the five factors of heredity, environment and
selection, blended with variation and isolation.  These
five factors build human characters, continue ever to
do their amazing sums in life and success and survival.
Sometimes they produce a Grace Rawn.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was the very factor of isolation that gave
Grace Rawn her quality.  She was a silent girl,
somewhat reserved.  Silence and reserve she got from her
father's solemn self-absorption, her mother's quiet
self-abnegation.  She was softened in part by the gentle
training of her mother, who talked most when her
husband was not present.
</p>

<p>
Grace Rawn stood two inches taller than her mother,
and had a certain severe distinction which covered
many sins in shorthand.  Her brows were dark and met
above her eyes; and the latter, being somewhat myopic,
usually were covered by glasses&mdash;which also not infrequently
shield yet other multitudes of sins in stenography.
Her chin was well out and forward.  Her jaw
was rounded, her teeth white and good, her carriage
also good, if still a trifle stiff and awkward.  In air she
was slow and deliberate.  Her eyes were gray like her
mother's, her voice deep like her father's.  She was
what would be called old for her years, indeed a woman
at sixteen.  Most would have placed her age some
years further on than the eighteen years which really
were hers at this time.
</p>

<p>
Grace Rawn could not be said to have any circle of
friends.  Her soul was eclectic.  In short, isolation,
selection and variation, the three less known laws
of growth, had done as much for her as the more
vaunted factors of heredity and environment.
Self-contained, adequate enough in appearance, although
lacking that sort of magnetism which draws men to
women, she would have passed with small notice in
the average collection of her sex.  For such as these,
propinquity comes as a blessing in so far as natural
selection is concerned.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
In St. Louis, natural selection operated much as in
the Silurian or the Elizabethan, or eke the Jeffersonian
age, choice being made from that which offered at the
family doorstep in either era.  In Kelly Row good folk
sat upon the doorstep of an eventide.  The evening
assemblage upon the Rawn front doorstep in Kelly Row
grew larger as Grace grew older.  Certain young men
came.  Why did they come?  Why do we walk about
and around a tree that hangs full in fruit not yet
ripened, watching the bloom on this, the texture of
that, the size or probable flavor of yonder example
hanging as yet unfinished in the alchemy of the
summer sun?  At least the little company at times was
larger on the Rawn front stoop of an evening.  It all
went on in the easy, careless, hopeful, unconventional
fashion of families of the Rawn class.  Let it be
remembered that class really is class in this country.
There seemed little hope for Grace, therefore, other
than in a marriage after the stereotyped fashion of
Kelly Row.  Perhaps if good fortune attended, she
might marry a man who, at middle age, might, like her
father, be drawing a salary of one hundred and twenty-five
dollars a month; a great man in the eyes of the
world of Kelly Row, which lived on an average of
half that per month.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
In this evening company, as Laura Rawn had mentioned,
occasionally might have been found one Charles
Halsey, himself now some twenty-four years of age at
next spring's lambing-time; as his father, a Missouri
farmer, would have said.  Halsey had come to the
city, a serious-minded youth, to seek his fortune, just
as John Rawn had done at about the time Halsey
himself was born.  But whereas Rawn had concerned
himself little in books, Halsey had, by such means as only
himself could have told, managed a degree in engineering
in what New England calls a freshwater college,
the same not so good as salt, yet, in Halsey's belief
better than none and cheaper than some.  Once out of
college and finding himself belated, he had thrust into
the thick of the fray of the business world to the best
of his ability, though to his surprise not setting the
world into any conflagration.  These four years now, as
chance had had it, he had been engaged in the drafting
department of the engineer's offices in the same railway
which employed John Rawn.  A thoughtful young
chap enough, and one held rather student than good
fellow by his fellow clerks, because for the most part
he did not join them in their dissipations, their cheap
joys, their narrow ways of thinking.  Also a chap
regarded as not wholly desirable because he read much,
and because he had ideas.
</p>

<p>
Charles Halsey, as well as Grace Rawn, in some sort
seemed to set the laws of heredity and environment at
defiance in favor of the lesser factors in evolution.  He
had originally no right to be anything but a farm lad,
yet he had dreams, and so had fought his way through
college.  There, in the world of books, close to the
world of thought, not far from the world of art, he
had become what some of us might have called an idealist,
what most of us would have called a fool, and now
what all of us would have called a failure.
</p>

<p>
A studious bent, a wide and unregulated way of
reading, a vague, inexact and untrained habit of
mentality, took young Halsey, as it does many another
unformed mind, into studies of social problems for
which he was but little fitted, to wit: into imaginings
about human democracy, the inherent rights of man,
and much other like folly.  The questions of socialism,
the rights and wrongs of capital, the initiative, the
referendum and the recall; the direct primary, the open
shop, and the living wage scale under the American
standard&mdash;all these and many other things occupied
him as much as tangents, curves and logarithms.  As
a result of his inchoate research, he started out in young
manhood well seized of the belief&mdash;finely expressed in
a certain immortal but wholly ignored document known
in our own history&mdash;that there is a certain evenness in
human nature before the eyes of the Lord.
</p>

<p>
A young engineer with small salary, and a
theoretical cast of mind, even though he reads text-books out
of hours, has only himself to trust for his upward climb
in life.  Surely he might be better occupied in wondering
rather about his pull with the boss than about the
eyes of the Lord as bearing upon the future of this
republic.  But, at any rate, such was the plight of
young Mr. Halsey.  And, such being the nature and
disposition of the doorstep-frequenting young, it
chanced that, although Grace Rawn really was not
yet fledged beyond the blue-tip stage of her final
feathering, and although Mr. Halsey of the Engineering,
draftsman, himself still lacked the main quills which
support a man in his ultimate flight through life, they
came more and more to meet each other; after which,
each in separate fashion came to enjoy the meeting
and to look forward to the next.
</p>

<p>
It was not unusual for Mr. Halsey, faring homeward
from the office, to meet Grace, also faring home, at
the turn of the car track on Olive Street.  Taking the
same car they would travel, somewhat shy and silent,
until they reached the distant corner where those bound
for Kelly Row must leave the car.  Then, himself
obliged by this to walk perhaps a mile farther, he
would join her, still shy and more or less silent; and
so perhaps again wander to that certain door in Kelly
Row where by that time, perhaps, both Mr. Rawn and
his helpmeet were sitting on the narrow porch.  He
was always welcome there, because Rawn knew him
for a steady chap; and because, in Halsey's eyes, John
Rawn was considerable of a personage.  Rawn was
aways ready to be consulted by the young, and, like
most failures, was not averse to giving abundant good
advice to others as to the problems of success.  Halsey,
reserved and not expansive of nature, a poor boy in
college, always had had a social world as narrow as
this of Kelly Row; so that after all the parties of both
the first and the second part were traveling mostly in
their own class.  On the whole it was rather a dour
assemblage, that on the porch in Kelly Row.  None
seemed to have any definite plan or to suspect another
of plan.  Life simply was running on, in the bisque
shepherdess, china dog, Dying Gaul and Rock of Ages
way.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Let us except John Rawn.  He now had certain wide
plans of his own, as we shall see&mdash;indeed, as we have
seen&mdash;and these had somewhat to do with young
Mr. Halsey himself.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Halsey himself was disposed at times rather to
moroseness, not yet having discovered the full relation
of liver and soul&mdash;a delicate and intimate association.
Sometimes despair oppressed him.
</p>

<p>
"Once in a while I get an idea," said he, one evening,
"and I think it might make good if I had a chance
to put it over.  But what's the use?  I couldn't do
anything with the best idea in the world, because I have
no time nor money to work one out.  I tell you, you've
got to have money or pull to get anywhere to-day.  This
country's getting into a bad way.  It doesn't look quite
right to me, I tell you, the way human beings are
ground under to-day."
</p>

<p>
And yet it was out of precisely such talk as this that
John Rawn originally got the reason for the enthusiastic
conversation with his wife which earlier has been
chronicled.  Behold the difference among men!  Here
was one who wanted to set all the world right, to
discover some panacea by which all men might rest in
happiness for ever, by which all men might succeed,
might indeed prove themselves free and equal, and
entitled to, say, ten minutes out of the twenty-four
hours for the pursuit of happiness&mdash;innocent happiness,
such as reading books on electricity, socialism, the
steaming quality of coke, or the tortional strength of
I-beams laid in concrete.  Here also, one lift above
him on the doorstep of Kelly Row, was another man,
John Rawn, who, thinking he was full of ideas, had
none, but who had every confidence in himself; a man
who early in his youth had proved his ability to leave
to others the skin of their bananas while he himself took
the meat, and paid naught therefor.  Not much of a
stage, thus set in Kelly Row.  But this is the stage
as it was set.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
Among these, there was one idea waiting to be born.
For, look you, the air is full of ideas&mdash;even as John
Rawn in ignorant truthfulness had said.  They float
all about us, unborn children in the ether of the
universe, waiting to be born, selecting this or that of
us&mdash;you, me, gently, for a parent; the most of them
to be pushed back unknown, unrecognized, into the
frustrate void, and so left to await a better time.  I
doubt not that, at this time or that, each of us has had
offered to him, thus gently, thus unknown, some idea
which would have made any of us great, set us far
above our fellow-man; ideas which for all of that,
perhaps would have revolutionized the world.  But
we did not know them.  What great things are left
unborn, what great discoveries remain unmade, no
man may measure.  We do not lay hold upon that
thin and vaporous hand which touches our shoulder.
We do not wrestle unwearied with the angel unto the
coming of the dawn.  So we go on, bruised and
broken, and at length buried and forgot, most of us
never grasping these unseen things, not even having a
hint of their immaterial presences.  It is only as the
jest-loving fates have it that, once in a while,
something in revolutionary thought drops to earth, is
caught by some materialistic mind, bred up by some
materialistic hand.
</p>

<p>
It must have been first at some chance meeting here
on the doorstep in Kelly Row that young Halsey let
drop reference to an idea.  It was the whisper of some
passing wing in the universal ether, but he did not
know that.  It is not always the mind of the idealist
which produces.  But now this thin, faint, mystic
sound had fallen upon the material mind of John
Rawn, covetous, eager, receptive of any hint to further
his own interest, concerned not in the least with
science, not in the least with altruism, troubling not
in the least over the fate of this republic or the welfare
of mankind, concerned only with his own fate,
interested only in his own welfare.  Whereupon John
Rawn&mdash;barring that certain prophetic outburst of
his egotism with which he favored his wife but
recently&mdash;in silence had accepted this sign and taken it
as his own, devised for his use and behoof, and for
that of none other than himself.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
This difference, then, lay between Rawn of the
Personal Injury department of the railway office, and
Halsey of the drafting offices; Rawn believed in
himself, Halsey had not yet figured out whether or not he
believed in anything.  They met on the doorstep at
Kelly Row, and out of their meeting many things
began in Kelly Row which matured swiftly elsewhere,
and in surprising fashion.
</p>

<p>
We now come on, sufficiently swiftly, to the history
of the birth and organization of the International
Power Company, Limited; a concern which grew out
of nothing except the five factors of survival&mdash;environment,
heredity, variation, selection and isolation.  Its
cradle was in Kelly Row.

CHAPTER VIII
<br />
POWER

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
"Charles," said John Rawn one evening, with
that directness of habit which perhaps we have
earlier noted, "I have been thinking over some
scientific problems."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" replied Halsey.  "What is it&mdash;a patent car
coupler?  There isn't a fellow in our office who hasn't
patented one, but I didn't know it was quite so catching
as to get into the Personal Injury department&mdash;they
only settle with the widows there."
</p>

<p>
"In my belief," went on Rawn, frowning at this
flippancy, "I am upon the eve of a great success,
Charles."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of success, Mr. Rawn?" inquired Halsey,
more soberly.
</p>

<p>
Rawn smiled largely.  "You will hardly credit me
when I tell you, almost all sorts of success!  To make
it short, I have formed a power company&mdash;a concern
for the cheap generation and general transmission of
power.  In the course of a few months we'll proceed
in the manufacture of electrical transmitters and
receivers for what I call the lost current of electricity."
</p>

<p>
Halsey stood cold for a moment, and looked at him
in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean to say&mdash;why, that's precisely what
<i>I've</i> been thinking of for so long."
</p>

<p>
"I don't doubt many have been thinking of it,"
rejoined Rawn.  "It had to come.  These things seem to
happen in cycles.  It's almost a toss-up what man will
first perfect an invention when once it gets in the air,
so to speak.  Now, this invention of mine has been
due ever since the developments in wireless transmission.
In truth, I may say that I have only gone a
little beyond the wireless idea.  What I have done is
to separate the two currents of electricity."
</p>

<p>
Halsey leaned against the wall.  "My God!" he half
whispered.  He smiled foolishly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr. Rawn," he said finally, "I've been studying
that, I don't know how long&mdash;ever since the researches
in my university were made public.  I thought
for some time I might be able to figure it out further
than our professors have as yet.  Pfl√ºger, of Bonn,
in Germany, has been working for years and years
on that theory of perpetual motion in all molecules."
</p>

<p>
"Mollycules?  I don't know as I ever really saw
any," hesitated Rawn.
</p>

<p>
"Very likely, Mr. Rawn!"
</p>

<p>
"I've never cared much for mere scientific rot,"
said Rawn, coloring a trifle.  "That gets us nothing.
But what were you saying?"
</p>

<p>
Halsey's enthusiasm carried him beyond resentment
and amusement alike.
</p>

<p>
"Molecules are everywhere, in everything,
Mr. Rawn," he explained gently; "and now we know they
move, though we can see them only in mass and as
though motionless."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how that can be," began Rawn; but
checked himself.
</p>

<p>
Halsey smote his hand against the solid wall.  "It
moves!" he exclaimed.  "It's alive!  It vibrates&mdash;every
solid is in perpetual motion.  The dance of the
molecules is endless.  It's in the air around us, above
us&mdash;power, power&mdash;immeasurable, irresistible power,
exhaustless, costless <i>power</i>!  All you have to do is to
jar it out of balance."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know.  That's what I've been getting at,
precisely&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I was going to figure it out sometime," said Halsey
ruefully.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>did</i> figure it out!" said John Rawn sententiously.
"Moreover, I've got the company formed."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
"<i>You</i>&mdash;Mr. Rawn?  How did you manage that?
I didn't know that you&mdash;" Halsey at last spoke.
</p>

<p>
"A great many haven't known about a great many
things," said Rawn, walking up and down, his hands
in his pockets, his air gloomily dignified.  "A few men
always have to do the things which others don't know
about.  For instance, what did all the work of your
professors&mdash;what-d'ye-call-'ems&mdash;amount to?  Nothing
at all.  Maybe they'd print a paper about it.  That
would about end it, just as it ended it for you.  You
admit you got the idea from them; but I say it wasn't
any idea at all.  I saw it&mdash;in the papers.  Didn't pay
much attention to it, because there's nothing in this
scientific business for practical men like me."
</p>

<p>
"I know, I know," Halsey nodded.  "That's true.
Here it all is."  He took from his coat pocket a
creased and folded newspaper page of recent date.
"Here's the story&mdash;I was proud, because it was my
own university did the work:
</p>

<p>
"'That the molecules composing all material
substances are constantly in rapid motion, ricocheting
against one another in the manner of a collection of
billiard-balls suddenly stirred up, the speed of the air's
components being about half that of a cannon ball,
was the proof announced to-day from the University
of Chicago as a further development of the experiments
by Professor R. A. Threlkeld, which for the last
year have been attracting the attention of scientists
from all parts of the world.  The absolute nature of
the proof, upon which physicists all over the world
have been working without result for several years,
was assented to by Professor Pfl√ºger, of Bonn
University, Germany, who arrived in Chicago last Monday
to witness the demonstration.'"
</p>

<p>
He paused in his literal reading from the printed
page.  "I told you about Pfl√ºger," he began.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, some Dutchman," assented Rawn graciously.
"They're great to dig."
</p>

<p>
Halsey, being in the presence of the man whom he
proposed making his father-in-law, was perforce
polite, although indignant.  He went on icily, with his
reading, since he had begun it:
</p>

<p>
"'The belief that the molecules of which all matter
is composed are in a perpetual dance of motion has
been held tentatively by scientists for several years,
but, owing to the general inability to make any
progress in proving it, considerable skepticism has
developed among the physicists of several of the leading
scientific nations.  It was generally known as the
kinetic theory.  Professor Threlkeld's proof is a further
development of his experiments, showing electricity to
be a definite substance, which were announced last
year and were pronounced the most important discovery
concerning the nature of electricity since
Benjamin Franklin.
</p>

<p>
"'The simple expedient of performing his experiments
in almost a complete vacuum&mdash;a method which
had not occurred to scientists before&mdash;was given by
Professor Threlkeld as the foundation stone of his
discovery.  Minute drops of oil, sprayed into a vacuum
chamber, one side of which is of glass, demonstrate
by their own motions the truth of the theory.

<p>
"'Surrounded by the ordinary amount of air, the
oil drops are bombarded by moving air molecules in
so many thousand places at once that their motion is
so rapid as to be invisible.  With few molecules of
air surrounding them, the drops are driven back and
forth as though being used as a punching-bag.
</p>

<p>
"'By reference to his previous experiments with
drops of oil bombarded by electrical ions, the motion
of the oil drops has been found to be precisely the
same, showing the cause of the motion to be similar in
both cases.'"
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said John Rawn, "all very well
as far as it goes, but it doesn't go far enough."

Halsey smiled.  "Well, here's what the discoverer
says about it," he commented.  "I reckon that's plain,
too, as far as it goes:
</p>

<p>
"'For the benefit of the general public, Professor
Threlkeld has prepared the following statement
concerning the experiments he has been conducting:
</p>

<p>
"'"The method consisted in catching atmospheric
ions upon minute oil drops floating in the air and
measuring the electrical charge which the drops thus
acquired.  This year the following extensions of this
work have been made:
</p>

<p>
"'"The action of ionization itself is now being
studied, each of the two electrical fragments into
which a neutral molecule breaks up being caught upon
oil drops at the instant of formation.  This study has
shown that the act of ionization of a neutral air
molecule always consists in the detachment from it of one
single elementary charge rather than of two or three
such charges.
</p>

<p>
"'"By suspending these minute oil drops in rarefied
gases instead of in air at atmospheric pressure, the
authors have been able to make the oil drops partake
of the motions of agitation of the molecules to such
an extent that they can be seen by any observer to
dance violently under the bombardment which they
receive from the flying air molecules.
</p>

<p>
"'"By measuring accurately the amount of the
motion of agitation of the oil drops and comparing it
with the motions which they assume under the influence
of an electrical field because of the charge which
they carry, the authors have been able to make an
exact and certain identification, with the aid of
computations made by Mr. Fletcher, of the electrical charge
carried by an atmospheric ion (and measured in their
preceding work), with the electrical charge carried
by univalent ions in solution.
</p>

<p>
"'"This work not only supplies complete proof
of the correctness of the atomic theory of electricity,
but gives a much more satisfactory demonstration
than had before been found of the perpetual dance of
the molecules of matter."'"*

<p>
"Fine!  Fine!  Charley!" interrupted Rawn sardonically.
"Everybody's read that who cared to read
it.  It's too dry for most folks.  It's public; it's wide
open, no secret about it.  But who wants it?  What use
has a mollycule and a drop of oil in a glass jar got in
actual business?  What ice does it cut?"
</p>

<p>
"I know&mdash;I know, Mr. Rawn; very little indeed.
But, one idea grows out of another.  Now, what I
was experimenting with was this same second current
of electricity&mdash;whatever it is.  It's got something to
do&mdash;I don't just know what&mdash;with this same movement
of the molecules.  Now, can't you see, something
has got to move them.  If you've got perpetual motion,
you've got a perpetual power somewhere back at it,
and a power that is endless, universal&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn," he resumed earnestly, "when I got
that far along, I got to&mdash;well&mdash;sort of dreaming!  I
followed that dance of the atoms on out&mdash;into the
universe&mdash;into the manifestation of&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, of what?"
</p>

<p>
"Of God!  Of Providence!  Of Something, whatever
it is that begins and perpetuates; <i>something that
plans</i>!  Something that created.  Something that
intends life and comfort and joy for the things It
created."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Rawn eyed him coldly.  "Charley," said he, "you're
talking tommyrot!  You can't run this world into the
spiritual world.  That's wrong.  It's irreligious.
Besides, it's rot."
</p>

<p>
Halsey hardly heard him.  "So then I began to
wonder what we'd find yet, when we had that vast,
universal power all for our own&mdash;all for man, you
know, Mr. Rawn.  Living's hard to-day, Mr. Rawn.
There's a lot of injustice in the world nowadays.
So&mdash;well, I wondered if it weren't nearly time that things
should change.  We've always moved on up&mdash;or
thought we did, anyhow&mdash;so why shouldn't we keep
on moving, keep on making discoveries?"
</p>

<p>
"That's what <i>I</i> thought, Charley!"
</p>

<p>
&mdash;"Something that would lighten the world's labor,
and give the world more time to think, more time to
<i>grow</i>&mdash;to enjoy&mdash;well, to <i>love</i>, you know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Charley, you're nothing better than a damned
Socialist!  You're siding with the lower classes.
Labor!&mdash;There's always got to be labor, long as the
world lasts&mdash;always has been and always will be.  And
some do that sort of work, while others don't.  There
are differences among men.  Look at those professors&mdash;look
at you!  A mollycule in a glass jar&mdash;what'd
it get you?  Did any of you form a company for the
perpetual sale of something that's everlasting and that
don't cost anything?  You didn't.  But <i>I</i> did."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And it was my dream&mdash;but not as you state
it, Mr. Rawn.  I didn't want to sell it.  I wanted to
<i>give</i> it.  I wanted to do something for the people, for
humanity&mdash;for the country&mdash;you see.  That is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Humanity be damned!" broke in John Rawn brutally.
"You <i>can't</i> do anything for humanity&mdash;you
can't make the weak men strong&mdash;it's God A'mighty
does that, Charley.  <i>Give</i> it away, eh?  Well, let me
have the second current that costs nothing, and let
me sell it for ever at my own price&mdash;and I reckon I'll
let you and your professor and Mr. Dutchman, whatever
his name is, trail along any way you like with
your mollycule in the glass jar.  I want canned
<i>power</i>&mdash;definite, marketable, something you can wrap up in
a package and <i>sell</i>, do you understand&mdash;<i>sell</i> to those
same laboring men that you're wasting your sympathy
on.  Work for <i>yourself</i>, my son, remember that;
never mind about humanity.  And I'll give you a
chance, Charley&mdash;in my company," he added.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
"Is it a big company?" queried Halsey wearily.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-five million dollars," answered John Rawn
calmly.  And it is to be remembered that at this time
John Rawn was drawing a salary of one hundred and
twenty-five dollars a month, the highest pay he had
ever received in all his life; also that he was at this
time a man forty-seven years of age.  We have
classes in America, but occasionally the lines that
separate one from the other prove susceptible of
successful attack at the hands of a determined man.  As
Rawn stood before Halsey, who only goggled and
gasped at such statements as his last, he seemed a
determined man.
</p>

<p>
"We are going to dam the Mississippi River, a
couple of hundred miles above here at the ledges,"
Rawn remarked casually.  "For the time, that will be
our central power plant.  We will contract for a
million and a half dollars' worth of power each year in
St. Louis alone.  That comes down by regular wire
transmission.  That is nothing, it's only a drop in the
bucket.  Our big killing is going to be with the other
scheme&mdash;the second current&mdash;the same idea you've
been trifling with.  We'll go East with that."
</p>

<p>
"You seem to mean almost what I mean, when I
talked with you long ago&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?"  Rawn's tone was affable and
he held out his hand.  "I should be happy indeed to
think that we had been studying along the same lines,
Charles.  That will enable you all the better to
understand my own ideas and my business plans.  Of
course&mdash;and I'll be frank with you, Charles&mdash;Mrs. Rawn and
I have doubted the wisdom of Grace's engagement to a
young man without means or prospects.  But I can
give you prospects, and you can make your own means.
I'll put you in our central factory.  We need good
men, of course, and I need you especially, Charles.
In fact, I've had you in my eye."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I shall be president of the concern."
</p>

<p>
Halsey smiled sardonically.  "The difference between
men!"
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, but you seem to think that you ought
to stand in my shoes in this matter, Charles.  I don't
recall any warrant for that."  Rawn spoke with
asperity, aggrieved.  "Of course, we speak loosely of
certain things, all of us, and all of us have unformed
wishes, all that sort of thing.  I'm willing to admit,
too, as I said before, that when the time comes for a
great idea to be discovered, it may be almost by
accident that it is discovered by this man or that.
</p>

<p>
"But now, as I take it, Charles," he continued, "you
never had any definite and exact idea of handling the
unattuned current of electricity which runs free in
the air, and which&mdash;according to my theory&mdash;can be
taken down by the proper receivers and used
locally&mdash;harnessed, set to work; and retailed at a price.
That's the wireless idea, of course, in one form.  It's
the one big thing left for big business to discover.
There's nothing left in timber, mines, irrigation,
railroads; cream's all off the country now.  But now here
comes this idea of mine, and it's bigger than any of
those old ones.  <i>Money?</i>"  He threw out his hands.
"Were you working on this yourself, my son?" he
concluded.  "How singular!  But it's in the air."
</p>

<p>
"Not very much," said Halsey honestly.  "I didn't
have time to work steadily at it.  We're pretty busy
in the office.  I did make a little model, though.  I
spent quite a lot of time on it, as I could."
</p>

<p>
"We are busy in our office, too," said Rawn grimly.
"But <i>I</i> found time.  We'll look over your model
together, some day."

CHAPTER IX
<br />
CHANGE IN KELLY ROW
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Unless the Day of Judgment shall, in its extraordinary
phenomena, accomplish that result, it is
scarcely to be held probable that any cataclysm
inaugurated by God or man ever will essentially disturb the
placid business of simply being alive.  Vesuvius
erupts; a few human ants are scorched.  A city
burns, and a few ant-hills perish.  An earthquake
rocks half a continent; the other half stands firm.
Nothing much matters, and nothing happens.  That
men fly in the air, that men talk across seas by
machines&mdash;as right presently they will talk mind to
mind, free of all mechanical hindrance&mdash;attracts no
attention beyond passing chronicle in the argot of the
day.  The large things of the age, of course, are the
ball games and the encounters of the prize ring.  Why
should we think?  Why should we feel apprehension,
whereas we know full well that, come what may&mdash;unless
that shall be, to wit: the ball game, the prize
fight, or the Day of Judgment&mdash;nothing really can
much matter, and nothing much can happen?
</p>

<p>
Nothing much happened in Kelly Row.  The old
monotony of business and domestic routine went on
with no alteration.  Grace went with her father daily
to the common and accustomed scene of their labors;
Mrs. Rawn baked bread, roasted meat when meat
could be afforded&mdash;for this was in the America of
to-day&mdash;swept the hall carpet and dusted off the Dying
Gaul; while as to Charles Halsey, he still read late at
night and made none too good use of India ink,
try-square and straight-edge by day.  No great disturbance
was to be noted anywhere.  All that was proposed was
that the people should be&mdash;with a very commendable
benevolence&mdash;offered the opportunity of purchasing
for ever, to the behoof of a very few, something that
had been given them free and for ever by the will of
God.  A simple thing, this, and of no consequence.  It
ranked not even with an earthquake; certainly not with
a ball game.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Yet, with sufficient steadiness, the plans for all this
went forward, and that with a commendable celerity
also; for John Rawn now proved himself no idler
in a matter where his own welfare was concerned.  He
and Halsey very often, in their daily meetings,
discussed their future plans; Halsey none too happily.
Rawn consoled him.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind about it, Charles.  You shall be my
right-hand man.  You'll be able to understand my
plans more perfectly than anybody else.  And listen,
Charles&mdash;" he laid a hand on the young man's shoulder,
"I'm not going to stand in the way of your own
plans.  You and Grace shall marry as soon as you
like, after we get this thing going.  It won't be long.
I shall have abundant means."
</p>

<p>
"How ever <i>did</i> you do it?" demanded the young
man, even as his face lightened at what seemed to him
the most desirable news in the world.  He had just
gained Grace's consent and her mother's, but dreaded
to ask that of her sterner parent.  "How in the world
did you manage it, Mr. Rawn?  You hadn't any
money, and you hadn't any influence."
</p>

<p>
"I did it by force of conviction," answered John
Rawn severely, setting his knuckles on the table and
leaning forward as he faced him.  "I did it by my
own original thoughts.  I impressed these other men
with the importance of my invention."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
He strode up and down now, as he went on: "I'll
tell you, Charles, so that you can understand these
things.  I suppose you do a certain amount of reading
on current events.  You must know, as we all do,
what a keen search there has been made by capitalists
all over the country for water power sites?  There
are few who know to what extent the greater power
sites have been monopolized already&mdash;that's kept
quiet, and the people don't care.  Oh, I admire them,
those leaders&mdash;those men who see into the future&mdash;those
men who are our kings in industry.  It's <i>there</i>
I've wanted to stand all my life&mdash;among them, in
their company, shoulder to shoulder with them, even-up
with them&mdash;or better.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, you know the newspapers and the
magazines&mdash;all of them managed by a lot of reformers
who have no weight in the world of affairs&mdash;have done
all they could to thwart the plans of these brainier
men.  But they can't stop what's going to happen.  A
few men are going to control the resources of this
country.  A few men are going to administer the business
affairs of this country.  It can't be stopped.  Even
the Supreme Court realizes that now.  Congress learned
it long ago&mdash;the Senate proves it every day of the
week.  My son, this invention of mine is going to make
that likelihood a certainty, a certainty!  I want my
place among those men, those few leaders who are to
control this country.  And I'm going to have it!"
</p>

<p>
Young Halsey, dull white, simply sat staring at him
as he went on.
</p>

<p>
"We all know what the old ideas of fuel and power
are&mdash;they're obsolete.  Electricity is the power of the
future, the power of to-day.  <i>Speed, speed, speed</i> is
what we want.  <i>Power, power, power</i> is what every
industry needs, as well as what every man craves.
</p>

<p>
"Now, heretofore, the only question has been to get
electricity over the country, to distribute it cheaply.
The water powers manufacture it well enough, but
even water powers cost money; and there has always
been a limit to the range of transmission.  Now,
when I set aside all these old, costly, inefficient
methods, and hand, ready-made, to the great capitalists of
this country the very answer to the last question they
have been asking, what is going to be the natural
result?  When I tell them that I can wipe out all this
enormous industrial waste that has been going on in
power, what are they going to say to me?  Are they
going to kick me out of their offices?
</p>

<p>
"They didn't kick me out.  When I went to them&mdash;a
few of them, men who run our road&mdash;and told them
that I could separate electricity into two parts, two
sorts, common and preferred, old and new, costly and
cheap, localized and wholly mobile&mdash;what were they
going to say to me?  They didn't kick <i>me</i> out of the
office!  They got up and locked the office door.  That's
what they did.  They were afraid I'd get away from
them!
</p>

<p>
"They had thought of these things before&mdash;about
as much as you have, I reckon.  That is, they had
<i>hoped</i> something would be discovered some time, by
somebody.  But I told them that I could send one-half
of this divided power up into the air, now!  I said I
could store it in the air without cost to any one, and
then take it down, at any manufacturing plant,
anywhere, any lighting plant, any enterprise using power,
whenever and wherever I pleased, at a cost not worth
mentioning&mdash;and now!  It was then they locked the
office door, for fear I'd get away."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"It's wonderful," said Halsey, warmly as he could.
</p>

<p>
"I told them that, as certainly as anything is
certain, I could take that stored charge out of the air,
and set it at work in Chicago, or Cleveland, or
Pittsburgh, or Minneapolis, or where I liked.  I said I
could put in the scrap heap every factory run under
the old and obsolete power methods.  Then they began
to sit up.  I had 'em pale before I got through!  I
tell you, Charles, I saw the president of this railroad
we have been working for look pale and sick when I,
I, John Rawn, one of his underpaid clerks&mdash;a man
who had had enough trouble to get to see him&mdash;who
had to make some excuse to get to see him&mdash;stood up
right to his face and proved these things."
</p>

<p>
Halsey, duller white, listened on as Rawn talked on.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, they didn't believe it&mdash;he called in his
crony, the general traffic manager&mdash;that beast
Ackerman&mdash;you see, they have some side lines of investment
together, on their personal account&mdash;and it makes 'em
a lot more than their salaries.  But they were afraid
not to believe what I said.  They tried to talk and
couldn't.  About all they could say to me at the end
of an hour or so was 'How much?'
</p>

<p>
"Then I <i>told</i> them how much," concluded John
Rawn.
</p>

<p>
"How much was it, then?" Halsey tried to smile,
palely.
</p>

<p>
"That is not for me to say.  Business men handling
large matters are pledged to mutual secrecy.  The
president of this railroad left for New York yesterday.
I'm taking chances in telling you this much, and
promising you as much as I have.  I would not do it if I
did not regard you as one of my own family.  You
must keep close in this, or else&mdash;"  A savage look
came into Rawn's face, which he himself would
scarcely have recognized, a new trait in his nature, kept
back all these years; the savagery of the stronger
having a weaker being in its power.
</p>

<p>
"Breathe a word of this, even to Grace," he said,
"and it'll cost you Grace, and it'll cost you more than
that."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Halsey made no answer but to sit looking at him,
his eyes slightly distended.  He loved this girl.  If
he must pay for that love, very well.  Love was worth
all a man could have, all a man could do.  He loved a
girl, and he was young.  Any price for her seemed
small.
</p>

<p>
Rawn allowed his last remark to sink in before he
resumed:
</p>

<p>
"It was some time ago that I went to these men.
They sent for me often enough after that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And could you prove it out?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute&mdash;don't interrupt me when I'm
speaking."  Rawn raised an imperious hand.  "They
sent for me, yes; until at length the president told me
they hadn't known they had had this big and brainy
a man right at their elbows all the time.
</p>

<p>
"Then," he went on blandly, unctuously, "they
showed me how large-minded and generous great
business men can be when you come to know them.  The
people don't know these great business men&mdash;why,
they're just as simple, and human, and kind!  They
said they wanted to identify me with their own fortunes.
For instance, they put me in for five thousand
shares of stock in a rubber company they are floating,
and some automobile stock.  The automobile industry
is sure to grow.  That rubber stock alone would make
me rich, I have no doubt."
</p>

<p>
"But what have you <i>done</i>?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute!  These men, it seems, are in with
a lot of other railroad men who are developing an oil
field in lower California.  They have been waiting till
things got ripe.  They've got two or three gushers
capped out there that they're holding back until they
get ready.  They'll make millions out of that alone.
These men play in with Standard Oil, and you know
how strong their hold is since the Supreme Court
threw down the cards.  A salary!  <i>I</i> a salary&mdash;what
did I make?  They have <i>their</i> salaries, but what do
such sums count with men of real genius in affairs?
</p>

<p>
"Well, they put me in for some of those oil shares,
too.  That alone would make me rich.  I could stop
right here, taking no chance, and be <i>rich</i>, now, to-day.
It pays to trail in with the right bunch.  What can the
muckrakers do toward stopping men like that?
</p>

<p>
"I'm telling you things which of course I ought
not to, but I know I can trust you, Charles.  And, as
I told you, I'm going to keep you about me in the
business.  I believe in you, my son.  We'll have plenty
of work to do together."
</p>

<p>
"Have you laid before them a complete plan, then,
Mr. Rawn&mdash;how did you figure it all out so soon?
I've worked on this a bit, and I never got much beyond
a model that didn't quite turn the trick."
</p>

<p>
"I would hardly be foolish," smiled John Rawn.
"They do not have my secrets.  Let them complete
their own plans.  Let them raise their money.  Let
them form their company.  Let them give me legally
my fifty-one shares of International Power for
control&mdash;then I'll tell them, not before.  It's a question
whether they're big enough to stack up in my class,
that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Why, you're like the Keeley motor man!" grinned
young Halsey.  "It lasted&mdash;for a while.  But can you
keep on putting this over with these people?"
</p>

<p>
"The president of this railroad started for New
York yesterday, I told you!  We've not been idle.
Two months ago we told our Senators in Congress
what we wanted in the way of laws in the matter of our
great central power dam.  Work is going on in the
state legislatures, both sides of the river.  Money?
There's no trouble raising money in America when you
have a valid idea&mdash;no, not if it's only one-tenth as
good as this.  And this is the best and biggest
monopoly this country ever saw.  They'll <i>pay</i> for an idea
like this!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
"It's an idea that'll rivet chains on this country!"
broke out Halsey suddenly, starting up.  "It's an idea
that'll make still worse slaves of this American
people!"
</p>

<p>
"Yet just a while ago," said Rawn, with a fine air
of Christian fortitude, "you said that you were trying
to get hold of this very same idea."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I was!  I am!  I did!  But I wanted to
take a burden off from the shoulders of the world, not
to put a greater there.  I wanted to lessen the dread
and despair that our people feel to-day.  I wanted to
work it out, I say, so that every man could have the
benefit&mdash;and <i>free</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Every man is going to have it," remarked John
Rawn grimly, "but <i>not</i> free.  What did I tell you a
while ago?  Get an idea, cinch it&mdash;and then sell it!
The people can have this benefit, yes; but they'll <i>pay</i>
for it.  That's the way success is made."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, is it so?" was Halsey's answer.  He flung himself
against the table, his pale face thrust forward over
his outspread arms.  "Success!  You mean only that
the corporation grip on this country will be stiffened
more than any one ever dreamed.  That's what your
idea means, then?  That's your success?"
</p>

<p>
Rawn nodded.  "Of course.  That has to be.  Business
conditions have changed.  I told you, a few men
are to control the destiny of this country.  Individual
competition&mdash;it's foolish now.  There are differences
among men.  We have to take the world as we find it,
and improve it if we can.  When a fortunate man hits
upon some great improvement in the living conditions
of humanity, he gets rich.  That's the way of life.
Why fight it?  Why not get on the right side, instead
of the wrong side of the world?  Why not trail in
with the main bunch, if that's where the money is?"
</p>

<p>
"Go on, then, go on!" said Halsey after a long
while, the expression on his face now changing.  "I'm
going to trail in, as you say.  When does the riveting
begin?"
</p>

<p>
"The public will be taken in when the larger interests
have completed all their plans," answered John
Rawn.  "The stock of International may not go on
the market for some time; indeed, I doubt if much of
it ever gets out beyond our fellows,&mdash;it's too good a
thing to share with the public.  I know what'll happen
with my fifty-one per cent.&mdash;it'll stay in my safety-box
until John Rawn is in need of bread.
</p>

<p>
"We start with fifteen million bonds," he continued,
"thirty millions preferred stock, with a forty per cent.,
common, as a bonus.  It looks as though the thing
would be all inside.  The management&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But you?&mdash;You'll think me personal&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  I'll hold the control."
</p>

<p>
"Of what?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Of all of it</i>," said John Rawn, gently smiling, as
he leaned his knuckles on the dingy table in the
dining-room in Kelly Row.
</p>

<p>
Halsey smiled at him, tapping his finger on the side
of his head.  "I see," said he.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not crazy.  <i>What</i> do you think you see?"
</p>

<p>
"Things don't happen in that way, Mr. Rawn.
Inventors don't get off in the money like that.  Don't
tell me that."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," said Rawn, dropping a clenched
fist on the table top.  "<i>Inventors</i> don't!  But men of
that same class&mdash;men of grip and grasp&mdash;<i>they</i> do get
off where the money is!  I'll show you.  They won't
rob John Rawn!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
"Did they take it easy?" queried Halsey finally.
</p>

<p>
"Threatened to kill me, that was all!  As I said,
they locked the door.  It was the traffic manager,
Ackerman, who took it roughest.  We both looked
along his pistol barrel.  'All right,' I said.  'Shoot.
Kill me, and what is there left?  You <i>can't</i> take me in
with you&mdash;it's only a question whether I'll take <i>you</i>
in with <i>me</i>!
</p>

<p>
"'Now, you listen,' I said to Standley and Ackerman&mdash;and
I wasn't afraid of them&mdash;'I'll show you how
to make something that everybody has to have.  I'll
put speed into the work of every laboring man&mdash;I'll
double his efficiency, double his hours and halve his
pay, and I'll cut off his ability to help himself.  I'll
make labor unions impossible.  I'll gear up, pace up,
stiffen up the whole theory of life and work, I tell
you, gentlemen,' said I, 'so that one hour will count
for two, one man will count for two, one wage will
count for two!  Do you get me, gentlemen?' I asked
of them&mdash;just those two were in the office then, and
the door was locked behind me.  'You're big men,' said
I, 'but you're not as big as I am.  It's a cheap bluff
about that gun,' I said to Ackerman.  'Put it up.  You
wouldn't dare kill me, or dare do anything I didn't
want you to.  I came to you because it was easier to
walk down this hall than it was to walk across the
street.  Do you want me to walk across the street?'"
</p>

<p>
Rawn chuckled gently; and now indeed he did present
the very image of self-confidence.  "Well, then,
they saw it," said he finally.  "They didn't want me
to walk across the street!  Standley laughed at Ackerman.
'No use to kill him yet,' says he.  I laughed then,
we all laughed.  'No, it wouldn't be any use,' said I to
them.  'The question is, how much I ought to give
you.'
</p>

<p>
"Ackerman took it hard.  He's a bulldog sort of
man.  'You're damned impudent!' said he.  'I'll have
you fired.'
</p>

<p>
"'I'm fired now!' says I to them.  'You think I'm
only a common clerk.  Didn't both of you come up
from clerking?  Can't I take you higher yet than where
you are now?'  The Old Man, Standley, nodded then;
and pretty soon he reached out and took my hand.
'Come in, son,' says he.  'You're on.'
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's nearly all there was about it, Charley.
I say to you, too, 'Come in, son&mdash;you're on.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
"Now then," he went on in his monologue, "we're
up to the wait while the laws are being made, and
while all the plans for financing the proposition are
going through.  We'll have to pro-rate this stuff with
the big railway companies, of course, and with the
oil and steel industries, and some of the other leading
combinations&mdash;Standley and Ackerman'll have no
trouble, with their acquaintance among the big men
of the East.  You can't stop such men.  Give them this
idea of mine and you can't keep them from controlling
this country.  These are things that can't be altered."
</p>

<p>
"But it will alter the world!" exclaimed young
Halsey, at last beginning to arouse.  "Who knows how
much power there is in the water of even one big
river?  You can use it over and over again.  Why,
on that one river&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Our river," said John Rawn, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"The people's river!" retorted Halsey fiercely.
"Their river!  God made that river, and all the rest
of them, for something, I don't know what.  But it
wasn't for this."
</p>

<p>
"It'll have to work," answered John Rawn.  "That
river'll have to work to earn its keep&mdash;they'll all have
to!"
</p>

<p>
"And the country&mdash;the republic&mdash;what will become
of it?"
</p>

<p>
"The republic?  That was a compromise.  We perhaps
had to live through that.  Conditions in government
change."  Mr. Rawn spoke largely, finely, with
a nice appreciation of all values.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" whispered Halsey.  "What do you mean?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IX
</p>

<p>
Rawn paid small attention to him, and he broke out
yet more vehemently.  "But it is an enormous thing&mdash;you
are dealing with the power of powers!  The
great force of the world is gravitation.  It makes the
world move, keeps the sun in its place.  Water running
down hill never tires.  <i>It</i> doesn't know any
eight-hour day."
</p>

<p>
"That term will cease to exist within two years,"
said John Rawn grimly.  "It is a detestable thing.  It
has hampered business long enough."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"There's no such thing as an arbitrary length for a
day's work.  The agreed day has lasted long enough.
Money is made by setting other men to work for you,
and then seeing that they do work.  When you have
something every man must use, when you've got the
final whip-hand, it's you who set the working day, and
not those who work for you."
</p>

<p>
"You're talking of using what God gave to human
beings, and talking of making worse slaves of them
to that gift.  That's monstrous, Mr. Rawn!"
</p>

<p>
"Is it, then?  To our notion it has been monstrous
what these labor combinations have tried to do.  Our
great industrial leaders have been used unjustly.  Yet
labor is only mechanical power, that has to eat, and
sleep, and wear clothes.  <i>Our</i> kind of power doesn't
have to do those things."
</p>

<p>
"But, Mr. Rawn!  if that were true&mdash;of course it
can't be true&mdash;what would there be left for the average
man?  I say that a man has a right to work when he
likes, and a right to stop when he likes."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely; but the labor unions say that he must
stop when they like.  Why don't you use your brains,
Charles?  The old war was between capital, that is to
say, concentrated power, and labor, which is
unconcentrated power.  That war has held back business in
this country for years.  Now, when I told these men,
Standley and Ackerman, that I had something which
would wipe out every labor union within a few
years&mdash;well, they <i>had</i> to come in with me, that was all.
They <i>had</i> to.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
X
</p>

<p>
"The trouble with you," contended Rawn, himself
now speaking fiercely as he loomed and lowered above
Halsey, "the trouble with all you dreamers is that
you have no real imagination.  What's the use talking
about the rights of the average man?  When did the
average man ever start or stop a revolutionary idea?
When these things come, they come, and you can't
help them.  They had machinery riots in Great Britain
a generation or two ago, but the spinning jennies
stuck.  It's always been so&mdash;progress sticks.  The
people have to adjust.  But why should capital keep
on fighting labor, or truckling to it, or treating with
it, when we can take labor for nothing, as you just
said, out of the power of gravitation&mdash;send it where
we like, practically for nothing&mdash;labor that is power,
labor that doesn't have to eat and doesn't have to be
paid wages?  I say if you had any imagination in your
soul, my son, you'd <i>rise</i> to a thought like that."
</p>

<p>
"But that average man still must eat," said Halsey
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Let him eat from our hands, then!" croaked John
Rawn harshly.  "I tell you, when I explained this
thing&mdash;when I showed them what we had in our
hands, those big men broke into a sweat.  They could
see it, if you can't.
</p>

<p>
"But as for me," he continued, standing erect and
spreading apart his hands, his voice softened almost
to tremulousness, "when I saw where this thing really
was going to put us all&mdash;in control of the labor
question&mdash;beyond the attacks of the muckraking
brigade&mdash;beyond the Supreme Court, if the time ever came for
that&mdash;when I saw what perfect political, legislative,
and industrial control we'd have in all this country&mdash;I
say, when I realized what all this meant, I felt small
and <i>humble</i>&mdash;I did indeed.  I saw that I was only
an instrument of Providence, that's all.  The people?
Why, we'll be the custodians of their welfare, that's
all.  Some men are set apart, devoted to that
duty&mdash;humble agents of Providence, my son."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
XI
</p>

<p>
A frown of consecrated unselfishness sat upon the
brow of John Rawn.  The younger man sat looking
at him, wondering whether there were not here really
some Homeric jest.  "I didn't know it was in you,"
said he, rather unfortunately, at last, and hastened
to cover: "That's right&mdash;it <i>is</i> imagination!"
</p>

<p>
Rawn raised a hand magnificently.  "Never mind as
to that, Charles.  A great many didn't know it was in
me.  Why, a few months ago I told my wife something
of this.  She asked if I'd ever be rich enough to
give her a silk dress!  When the factory's up and the
wheels are moving&mdash;then I'll take her out to the place,
and I'll say to her just what you said to me&mdash;'You
didn't think it was in me, did you?  But it was!'  Women
nearly always think their husbands can't do
anything in the world.  A silk dress!  My God!  And
she wanted a new gate in the picket fence, too."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know that about women," said Halsey
simply.  "I thought it was the other way about."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, I hope it may be that way in your case.
Listen, Charles.  I love my girl, Grace.  She has
always been a good child.  I'm putting you in a place
where you can take good care of her.  I want you to
stick to her for ever, through thick and thin.
Remember, my son, that your wife is your wife, and that
nothing must separate you from her."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe it'll work out something after my idea, after
all."  Halsey spoke pleasantly as he could at this
mention of Grace.
</p>

<p>
"We'll take our chances but what it will work out
our way!" said John Rawn, grinning in return.  "You
want to work for <i>man</i>, do you?  Well, I want men to
work for <i>me</i>!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
XII
</p>

<p>
"But we've no quarrel," he said suddenly, wheeling
about.  "We'll be partners from the start.  There are
some minor particulars to work out.  I've got to have
some sort of shop out in the back yard.  Bring your
little machine there&mdash;the model you said would not
quite work."
</p>

<p>
"How long before we begin, Mr. Rawn?" asked
Halsey simply.
</p>

<p>
"I have my last pay envelope in my pocket now,
to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't they give you any capital to start with?"
</p>

<p>
"I did not dare ask it."
</p>

<p>
"But how much funds have you of your own?"
</p>

<p>
"Mighty little.  I've been kept down all my life.  It's
been pretty much week to week with me, although
Laura's been a wonderful manager, I'll say that."
</p>

<p>
"I've saved a little money," said Halsey, quietly as
before.  "I even believe Grace has saved her salary&mdash;eight
a week.  You see, we were making plans&mdash;here's
my bank-book.  A little over five hundred.  How
much would you need, Mr. Rawn, to take care of you
for the next few days that you require for this work?"
</p>

<p>
"I've got to have some working models made, and
it'll take some cash," said Rawn.  "I've hardly had
time to work out all these things as yet.  All right.
All the more pleasure for you to feel that you had a
hand in it."
</p>

<p>
He reached across the table and took the dog-eared
bank-book which Halsey extended, and ran his eye
down the column of pitiable figures.  The total was
more than he himself had ever saved in all his life.
Yet John Rawn stood there now calm, large and
strong, and spoke in millions.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
XIII
</p>

<p>
"All right, Mr. Rawn," said Halsey cheerfully.
"Take it along.  I'll draw the balance out for you.  I
reckon Grace and I won't have to wait any longer this
way than we would the other."
</p>

<p>
"Well, be mighty careful to keep things to yourself,
that's all!" was Rawn's answer.  "If you're going to
be my son-in-law, you're going to be loyal to my ideas.
One of my ideas is that a man has a right to what he
can take."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn, do you know anything about socialism?"
asked Halsey suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Not very much.  Why should I?"
</p>

<p>
"There's sort of a brotherhood, or chapter, or
society, or what you'd call it here, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I've heard so."
</p>

<p>
"And they let anybody who is interested come to
the meetings&mdash;I've been there often&mdash;did I ever tell
you?  Our rooms are up-stairs over a saloon, up
under the rafters.  We have lanterns there, the way
the revolutionists used to have over in Europe,
when they had to meet in secret.  We have speakers
there sometimes&mdash;from Milwaukee, New York, even
from Europe.  And I want to tell you it's astonishing
what a talk you'll hear there sometimes, from some
chap that you wouldn't think had it in him&mdash;just
rough-dressed fellows that look as if they hadn't a
dollar in the world."
</p>

<p>
"They usually haven't," said John Rawn coldly.
"They want to get the dollars of men like myself and
my friends, who really have done something in the
way of developing this country.  But one thing sure,
you'll cut out that brotherhood business when you go
to work with us.  The rights of man!&mdash;the future of
this country!  Why, good God, boy, with the grip
you can get on business, with us to help you, what
difference does it make to you whether you call this
a republic or anything else?  What <i>is</i> this republic?
That is, what <i>was</i> it?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
XIV
</p>

<p>
Halsey sat staring at him fixedly for some time,
without making answer.  Rawn, carelessly buttoning
up in his pocket the bank-book, as though it had been
his own, rose at length and held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"You're a good boy, Charles," said he.  "You've
done the best you knew, and that's about all I've done.
You couldn't say, of course, that our ideas have been
the same in regard to this discovery, so I suppose we
can't wonder they are not the same in regard to its
eventual application.  Let's not argue about that.
We'll start out with our little shop, the first thing."
</p>

<p>
The young man still looked at him, still withheld
comment.  Rawn, once more full of himself, almost
forgot him now.  He stood erect, his arms spread out,
in a favorite posture, as though exhorting a multitude.
A pleasant, gentle, generous smile spread over his
countenance, a smile which showed his content with
himself, his future prospects, his past performances.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have been there with me, Charles,
when I talked to old Standley and his side partner,
Ackerman.  <i>That</i> was the big scene of my whole
life!"
</p>

<p>
"The big scene?" said Halsey, half musingly.  "No!
Maybe not.  We don't know what there may be on
ahead."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that the truth!" assented John Rawn graciously.
"When a man of brains and energy gets his
start, there's no telling where he won't go, or what he
won't do.  Yes, that's the truth!"

CHAPTER X
<br />
THE WOODSHED IN KELLY ROW
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
The one astonishing thing about life, as we have
but now mentioned, is its utter commonplaceness.
It is a terrible thing to die, to end our connection with
life as we know it; yet folk die, and the world accepts
the fact with not more than a few hours' concern.
Folk are born, a very wonderful thing, yet a common.
We flash messages across the sea&mdash;as soon we shall
across the ether, to other planets.  The latter event
will be but of brief interest.  We travel by impounded
steam, and have long ago ceased to marvel at that
miracle.  Soon we will travel by means of other power,
at speeds inconceivable to-day.  Were that time here
we would not wonder.  It is all, all commonplace.  And
none of us does much thinking.  It is only over the
unimportant things that we ponder.  Thus, over a revolution
in politics we chatter excitedly; but the revolution
in principles excites us not at all.  The revolution in
science, in thought, in life, is accepted, when it comes,
with no concern, as though belonging to us from time
immemorial; as indeed it did.
</p>

<p>
It was wholly within human practice that affairs
should now go on at Kelly Row much as they had
always gone, in spite of the fact that Kelly Row now
harbored, in a certain woodshed back of the dingy
Rawn abode, ideas and deeds that had not earlier been
known in Kelly Row routine.  Here Mr. Rawn and his
intending son-in-law were carrying on experiments
whose most immediate result, in case of success, would
be the extrication of Mr. Rawn from rather an
awkward situation; because, although Mr. Rawn, in the
usual and commonplace human fashion, had taken as
his own an idea when he saw it, he negligently had done
so forgetful of the fact that it still lacked many
features as a definite commercial proposition.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Rawn had told the truth regarding his resources.
He had but one month's salary in his pocket when
these final experiments began, and for this money
there was just as much need as there ever had been in
any other month; for Laura Rawn had quite as much
use, at the going scale of living, for one hundred and
twenty-five dollars a month now, as she had had for
seventy-five dollars a month five years earlier.  Yet
when Laura Rawn suggested a deferred payment on
certain weekly bills, the shopkeepers to whom she had
been paying her stipend daily for years demurred
sorely.  The truth is that the poorest way in the world
to establish a credit is to pay bills in cash.  Foolishly
allow a man to see your cash, and he can see nothing
else.  Pay him partly in cash, partly in good checks,
partly in bad ones, and partly not at all, and he will
trust you largely; this being a commercial truth not
known of all men, although worth knowing.  It may
be seen, therefore, that young Halsey's little capital
of five hundred dollars was as important as young
Halsey's original idea; which latter Mr. Rawn had
also appropriated.
</p>

<p>
So now these two bought very considerable bundles
of copper wire and other things, and made several
machines of this and the other shape, and tried divers
experiments which need not be set down here.  In
all this work young Halsey's manual skill and
technical training continually was in quest, John Rawn
for the most part standing by and frowning heavily,
watching Jacob labor for the earning of Rachel: for
Halsey knew this surrender of his idea was the price
of Grace.  Halsey had little hope of ultimate success
in his appliances.  Not so Rawn.  He had something
akin to a feeling of certainty.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Differing thus&mdash;yet who shall say they were not
partners, after all, since all these things were true
regarding them?&mdash;they at last emerged from the
woodshed in Kelly Row, after many long weeks, whose
deeds we need not further chronicle.  They carried
into the front room of the Rawn house in Kelly Row
a small machine, which presently was to do large
things; that is to say, to save the self-respect of
certain prominent railway men who by this time were
convinced that they had been hypnotized to their
disadvantage; and also to save the face of John Rawn,
although he had not known his face had needed
saving.
</p>

<p>
This novel and mysterious little machine, with a
glass jar underneath, many coils and wheels within,
and an odd, toothed crest of little upreaching metal
fingers, had been produced only at great cost, great
sacrifice.  It had seemed wholly right and reasonable
that all of young Halsey's five hundred dollars should
disappear little by little, and it had done so, long ago.
It seemed proper that the small savings which Grace
had deposited in a tin baking-powder can&mdash;for she
was like her mother, part ground-squirrel, and
secretive&mdash;should also disappear little by little, and
they also had gone.  In some way, only the women
knew; how, they all had had enough to eat, so far as
that meant actually necessary food; but the entire
Rawn family were a gaunt and haggard, as well as a
wearied and anxious quartette, when finally they
gathered about the little machine out of the woodshed.
Their play was on one card, and the card was turned.
What was it?
</p>

<p>
If either of the women doubted, she held her peace.
Rawn did not doubt.  He had been sure all along that
Charles Halsey, engineer, would work out his,
Rawn's, idea.
</p>

<p>
And young Halsey, engineer, had done that very
thing.  There is no roof in all the world ever has
covered a vaster and more epoch-making thought than
did the patched cover of the woodshed in Kelly Row.
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of the day wherein they emerged
from the woodshed, these two, none too well clad,
took the street-car to the city, Halsey with a
newspaper bundle under his arm.  In it was what Mr. Rawn
called his second-current motor, which comprised the
basic idea of International Power, soon to loom large
in the business world.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br />
THE TEST
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
In the most commonplace way in the world, and
quite as though he had always done this very thing,
Mr. Henry Warfield Standley, president of the
I. &amp; D. A. Railway Co., warned in advance by Mr. Rawn's
telephone, came to the door himself.  Presently the
three, Rawn, Halsey and the president of the
company for which both so long had worked, sat at the
long glass-covered table, where lay many papers.  The
president pushed a button and ordered the attendance
of Mr. Theodosius Ackerman, the general traffic
manager; so that now they made four in company.
The G.T.M., as he was known, had suffered great
abrasion of the nerves by the delay of Mr. Rawn to
produce a machine done up in a newspaper or in any
way whatsoever, and he had joined the president in
a disgusted belief that in some way he had been made
foolish.  He frowned now savagely at John Rawn, and
John Rawn now, his hat on his head, frowned quite as
savagely at him.
</p>

<p>
Very little was said, but after a time young Halsey
nervously removed the newspaper from his little
machine, and displayed it uncovered on the table, a ribbed
and coiled and toothed little model, showing file marks
here and there, and resembling nothing in particular
in the world.  They four regarded it calmly, curiously,
this machine destined in the belief of some to
double the length of the workman's day, to halve the
distance around the world, to make or break fortunes,
to make or break a country.  The president started to
jest, but his voice shook a trifle after all.  To the
general traffic manager the contrivance seemed
absurdly small and inadequate.  He choked so much he
could not talk.  Rawn did not smile.  He continued
his heavy frown.  Young Halsey, tacitly elected
spokesman by Rawn, cleared his throat as he
addressed the president of the road, for whom he still
felt naught but awe.
</p>

<p>
"We have put our receiver in tune with the dynamo
in the basement of this building, Mr. Standley,"
began he, finally.  Both the magnates frowned at
Mr. Halsey's presumption and turned to Mr. Rawn.  The
latter waved a large gesture.
</p>

<p>
"I forgot to say, gentlemen, that Mr. Halsey has
aided me in working out my model, and it is just as
well he should explain my idea."  Halsey therefore
went on:
</p>

<p>
"And now you can see right here, on the table before
you, about all the rest of it that we have.  It
isn't attached to anything at all.  There is no wired
connection of any sort whatever.  Now if we can run
that electric fan over there with 'juice' that we can
take right out of the air&mdash;with the second current
which we take out of the motor in the basement&mdash;just
as well as the primary current wired to the fan will
run it, why, then, it looks to me as though our
receiver here ought to be accepted as a working device."
</p>

<p>
The room was silent now.  They sat looking at him.
He resumed:
</p>

<p>
"Besides, this receiver is more powerful than you
think.  I suppose I could burst that fan wide open
with it, by just wiring the two, after disconnecting
the original wiring of the fan to the house dynamo."
</p>

<p>
Halsey spoke very calmly, yet the hands of the
president of the road, resting on the edge of the table,
trembled slightly.  The fighting red had disappeared
from the face of the G.T.M.  He was bluish gray, as
though deathly ill.  He was, however, the first to
recover.  "Well, why <i>don't</i> you burst it, then?" he
exclaimed savagely, mopping at his forehead.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Halsey quietly.  "But first I
suppose I ought to explain just a little about the basic
idea under this whole proposition.  You see that table
there&mdash;we regard it as motionless.  As a matter of
fact, it is full of nothing but motion, so tremendously
rapid that we are unconscious of it.  That wall yonder
is nothing but a continuous series of vibrations, of
inconceivable rapidity.  This floor is full of force, of
energy.  It's all around us&mdash;energy, force, motion.
</p>

<p>
"In your studies in physics, gentlemen, you learned
that heat and motion are convertible.  And you
learned about the resultant of power&mdash;which always,
so far as any accepted law of physics goes, is in ratio
to the distance through which applied.
</p>

<p>
"Now, what I've done," said Halsey&mdash;John Rawn
frowned and coughed heavily, but no one noticed him,
and Halsey himself was unconscious of using the first
personal pronoun&mdash;"is just to cut off all need of
considering the distance through which force is applied.
Now, I don't know whether I can make it entirely
plain to you, except by physical demonstration, but
what I've done here is to carry further the idea of
wireless telegraphy.  We have here, to use an
understandable figure of speech, a receiver which is the
equivalent of a sounding-board&mdash;a sounding-board in
tune to the vibrations of the second or free current of
electricity.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, our idea was, in terms, that of harnessing
up molecular activity.  If we have done that, we
have, of course, tapped the one exhaustless reservoir
of power."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
The president of the railway had grown yet paler;
but he nodded wisely, and Halsey went on:
</p>

<p>
"There isn't any miracle in science that ought to
cause us any wonder.  It took science a long time to
learn that heat and motion are interchangeable.  I
strike a cold piece of iron with a moving hammer, and
the iron gets hot.  It was cold before, and there hasn't
been any fire near it.  That's just as wonderful a
thing&mdash;although we all accept it without question&mdash;as
all that I've got here on the table before you.  If I
can stop some of the free energy that is vibrating all
around us, I'm going to get either motion or heat
out of it, and that's simple.  We have gone far enough
to know that this little receiver here, gentlemen, will
arrest the free current of electricity, force, energy,
whatever you care to call it, that's in the air and
which can be multiplied and transmitted through the
air.  Why and how it does that, I can't just tell,
myself.  No one has ever been able to explain everything
about the magnetic needle, but we use it just the
same.  We don't so much care what it is if we can
use it."
</p>

<p>
"Not a damned bit!" growled the G.T.M.  "But
can we?  Why don't you get busy with that fan?"
</p>

<p>
Halsey rose and went over to the electric fan and
snipped off a length of the wire, so that the fan stood
free and unattached on its shelf.  The loose wire he
now busied himself in attaching to the fan and in turn
to the little model on the table.
</p>

<p>
"To my mind," said he, after finishing this work,
and arresting a finger above a little connecting lever
in the side of the receiver, "it's a very beautiful
thought that underlies all this.  The forces which run
through this receiver will never grow tired.  Labor
will be a joy for them, a delight, as labor ought to be
in any form.  Mr. Rawn and I don't always quite
agree about that," he smiled, still with his finger
above the little lever.  "What I hope to do is to change
the working-man from being an object back into being
a man, so that labor may be a joy and not a dread."
</p>

<p>
"Then we don't want it," grinned the president,
feebly essaying a jest.  "Mr. Rawn and I were agreed
that it would do just the other thing!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, go on with it!" growled Ackerman.  "I'm
a busy man.  To hell with the story!  We want
results!"
</p>

<p>
Every man present sprang back from the little
instrument on the table.  There came a slowly increasing
purr of the motor, a series of intense blue sparks
showing at the toothed points of reception.  The
blades of the fan began to revolve faster and faster;
so fast that at length both eye and ear ceased to
record their doings.  Then, after sight and sound had
failed to serve, there came a crash!
</p>

<p>
There was no fan on the shelf where it had stood.
Fragments of metal were buried in the woodwork, in
the wall.  John Rawn wiped the blood from a cut on
his cheek.  No one said anything.  It was quite
commonplace, after all.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"You wished to see what it would do," said Halsey
grimly.  "The power seems to be there.  Any time
you like, any amount you like.  And you saw that it
didn't come in here by wire&mdash;it was only transmitted
from the receiver, not to it.  The fan is broken, but
the receiver is just the way we left it.  Well, it looks
as though we had settled a few questions, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Standley, pale, could only gasp, "Why, it's&mdash;it's
dangerous!" he said.  "It's devilish!  Look there!"  He
pointed at the blood on Rawn's face.  Rawn
remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"There is no use applying undue force to a minor
purpose," said Halsey, "any more than there is in
throwing on the high speed of a car going down hill.
But our reserve is there, gentlemen, just the same.
By increasing the size of our receivers we can develop
power to turn any amount of machinery that can be
geared together&mdash;any number of machines, large or
small, at any place.  I only wanted to show what the
real power is in this device of ours.  Our receiver is
very small, you see."
</p>

<p>
They all remained silent for a time.  Standley at
last drew a long breath.
</p>

<p>
"We're saved!" said he.  "What do you say to it,
Jim?"  This to Ackerman.
</p>

<p>
"It looks like a go," said the latter, drawing a deep
sigh.  "We've seen enough right here to make good
with our people back East; and we've got enough right
now to get the public in."
</p>

<p>
The president turned an agitated eye upon John
Rawn.  "Mr. Rawn," said he, "referring to the tenor
of our earlier conversation, I desire to say that we
are not in the habit of giving the lion's share to
anybody&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Suit yourself," said John Rawn, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"But in this case, as I said to you at first, there's
so much in this if there's anything at all, that there's
no use splitting hairs over it."  He receded rapidly
from the position he coveted but saw he could not hold.
</p>

<p>
"We ought to begin work at once.  Er&mdash;Mr. Rawn,
do you happen to have any present need for any
money&mdash;personally?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered John Rawn calmly, "I am in no
need of funds.  When the organization is completed,
and I begin my work as president of the power company,
I shall be glad to go on the pay-roll, of course.
I should add now that I expect Mr. Halsey to be my
general manager in the mechanical department."
</p>

<p>
"In regard to salaries," said the president, hesitating,
"we might roughly sketch out something&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My own salary will be a hundred thousand dollars
a year," said Mr. Rawn quietly.  "I don't think we
should ask Mr. Halsey to work for less than five
thousand.  Do you, gentlemen?"
</p>

<p>
"I've worked for less, myself," said Ackerman
grimly.
</p>

<p>
"There shall be no haggling, gentlemen, no haggling,"
said the president blandly.  "It shall be as
Mr. Rawn suggests.  By the way, a near call that,
Rawn."
</p>

<p>
He waved a hand at the bloody cut on our hero's
face.  That gentleman drew a half sigh of unconscious
triumph.  It was the first time any one in that office
had ever dropped the "Mister" from his name!  He
saw himself entering into the charmed circle.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose it had come a half inch closer?"
suggested the president.
</p>

<p>
"It didn't," said John Rawn.  "It was never meant
to."
</p>

<p>
"That's the talk!" drawled Ackerman.  "I'll tell
you, Rawn, come in to-morrow.  We'll get the patent
lawyers and our corporation counsel, and begin work
on this thing."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
That was all there was about it, the proceedings
being wholly prosaic and commonplace.  Mr. Halsey
found again his newspaper, again wrapped up his
machine therein, took it under his arm, and hesitatingly
turned toward the door, the palest now, and
most unhappy of them all.  He had denied his own
first-born.  He had publicly disclaimed ownership in
this idea.  Rawn was to have a hundred thousand dollars
a year, he only a twentieth of that.  Just where
and how was Rawn twenty times as valuable as himself,
when all the time it had been he.&mdash;But then, what
matter?  Five thousand dollars a year and Grace!
What more could any man desire than that?  He
forced that to console him, forced himself to believe
it sordid to haggle on the price of love; and so passed
down in the elevator, out through the corridors to
the street, without much further speech to any.
</p>

<p>
"Charles," said his intended father-in-law, as they
approached the nearest corner, "do you happen to
have a quarter left?  I feel somewhat hungry, and
for the time I have no money at all with me."

CHAPTER XII
<br />
THE HELPMEET
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
After all, Charles Halsey still was young enough
to be happy.  There are really very few delights
for the man nearing middle age.  The period of joy
in living is confined to what time, passing upon the
crowded street, the young man notes the sidelong,
half-concealed glance of the unknown young woman,
unconsciously taking in his goodliness, his god-like-ness,
such as that may be; or to what time the young
woman, in turn, after some such incident, turning by
merest chance to look at some passing cloud, or to note
the brightness of the sky, finds that some young man
whom she but now passed also has turned about, by
mere chance, to examine the colors of the sky, and so
by accident has fastened gaze upon her instead!  As
the grasshopper cometh on to be a burden, the time
arrives when this or that gray-browed man may gaze
at passing damsel and elicit no reward in turn.  Sitting
in crowded vehicle he glances above the rim of his
paper, and suddenly smiles to himself that his mature
charms have riveted the attention of the young girl
across the aisle.  Happy moment&mdash;were it not that
closer scrutiny would prove the young girl's eye
to be fixed, not upon middle age, but upon
ruddy-faced youth in the seat beyond!
</p>

<p>
No hope for Graybeard after middle age, when the
grasshopper is a burden; save such hope as may be his
through the power of money.  Thenceforth perhaps
remain for him only such self-deceits as that money
may purchase fidelity, joy, love, happiness of any
sort; which deceits end later on, in that hour of severe
self-searching which remains for each of us just
before we depart for other spheres.  As for this
particular obloid sphere and its tenantry, there are two
seasons&mdash;a season of growth and flower, a season of
seeding and decaying.  As for delights, life passes at
that indefinite period, from twenty-five to fifty-five
years of age, let us say, when the opposite sex, passing
us unknown upon the street, turns no longer the
inadvertent sidelong gaze!
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
When John Rawn walked toward his home after
the events of the meeting last foregoing described, he
cast few sidelong glances, and received few.  If that
were faithfulness to a worthy wife, make the most of
it.  Upon the other hand note that, as Mr. Halsey trod
the air on his way to Kelly Row, his newspaper bundle
under his arm, there did not lack abundance of young
women who saw him from the corner of the eye as
he passed on.  Forsooth, he was a young man of very
adequate physical appearance, clean, hard, high of
cheek, square of shoulder, his hair dark and long, his
eye gray, direct, kindly.  His life hitherto had been
so narrow that he had lived well and wisely.  His
powers were well preserved, he remained physically
clean and fit.  Rather a decent chap, you would have
called him, as he passed now, his strong chin well
forward, his eye shaft-like and strong in its glances.  Not
an extraordinary young man, perhaps, but certainly
serving well enough to show that youth speaks to
youth; and that, when youth is past, all is past.
Excepting&mdash;as John Rawn would have noted&mdash;the making
of money; which means not much to youth itself,
but which means all to middle age.
</p>

<p>
Of all this very wise and useful philosophy, be sure,
Mr. Halsey was ignorant, or regarding it, was
indifferent.  He had forgotten that almost his last silver
coin had furnished Mr. Rawn his last meal, in which
Halsey himself had not joined.  Grace!  That was in
his mind.  He was young.  Success was now at hand;
because presently he should have five thousand dollars
a year in salary, and be married to the dearest girl in
all the world.  It is, always the dearest girl in all the
world, for men when they are less than thirty-five,
say twenty-five years of age.  But Halsey did not
philosophize.  He was guided only by some unconscious
cerebration when he descended from the street-car and
bent his way toward Kelly Row.  He pulled up at the
stoop of the third house in that homely procession of
brick abodes which rented for twenty dollars a
month&mdash;with no repairs by the landlord.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
He found Grace at home, Mrs. Rawn also at home.
They came to meet him, laid hold of him before he
was well into the narrow little hall.  There was that
in his face, in his eyes, in his soul which told them
that success at last had come to Kelly Row.
</p>

<p>
He put his hand in Mrs. Rawn's, his arm about
Grace's waist.  They two were young, they were very
happy.  Their hands were interclasped when presently
they all passed from the hall into the little parlor.
The eyes of Grace Rawn became soft, luminous,
tender.  The young man had come into her life.  She
was very happy.  She was young.  Ambition was as
yet unknown to her.  Her coin-current was not yet
money; which of all things has the very least of
purchasing power.  She was almost beautiful now.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Rawn, grave, thin, careworn, bent by many
trials, her hair gray above her temples, her eyes
dark-rimmed and, sunken somewhat under her dark-arched
brows, had seated herself upon the opposite side of
the room, waiting, her own joy visible in the silent
illumination of her face.  She, too, was very happy in
her way; or rather, mildly contented.  While almost
every woman, at one or other period of her life
admires what is known as a wicked young man; the
average mother having a daughter about to be
married admires rather what is known as a good young
man.  And Charles Halsey was what may be called
comprised within that loose and indefinite description,
not always covering admirable or manly qualities, but
in this case serving very well.
</p>

<p>
"You've won, Charley," said Laura Rawn at last.
"It is true!  Thank God!"
</p>

<p>
For these blessings about to be received, Mr. Rawn
thanked himself; Grace thanked Charles; Charles
thanked Grace; only Laura Rawn had nothing left to
thank excepting an impersonal and remote deity.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
They sat for a time thus in the little parlor, amid
an abomination of desolation in black walnut horrors,
tables done after a French king who must have
revolved in his grave at contemplation thereof, chairs
requiring nice feats in balancing upon their slippery
haircloth floors, a sofa of like sort, too large for one,
yet not large enough for two.  There gazed down
upon their love&mdash;as though in admiration as to love's
consequences&mdash;rows of bisque shepherdesses and
china dogs.  The Dying Gaul also bent on them a
saddened gaze.  None the less, in spite of all, young
Halsey shamelessly maintained his position on the
perilous sofa, an arm around young Miss Rawn's
waist.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Laura Rawn sat across the room, something still
dangling from her grasp which had been there when
she met Halsey in the hall.  Halsey at length caught
sight of this object.  Glancing from the mother's
hands toward those of the daughter, Halsey caught
up the latter, looking with close scrutiny at what was
now to be his own.  He found the ends of Grace's
fingers blackened and rough.  He glanced back again
to her mother's hands, worn with toil.  The ends of
her fingers, also, grasping this loose something, were
blackened and rough.
</p>

<p>
"No more work for Grace," said he, lovingly tightening
his clasp on the fingers in his own.
</p>

<p>
"But I say&mdash;" this to Grace&mdash;"what makes your
fingers so rough, dear?  I never did notice that before."
</p>

<p>
"You've not noticed anything for two months!" said
Grace chidingly.  "Why, it's sewing, of course, that
does it.  A needle roughens up one's finger in spite of a
thimble, don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
"You were sewing&mdash;for <i>us</i>?" he ventured daringly,
yet blushing as he spoke.  "A girl has a lot of sewing
to do, I suppose&mdash;when she's&mdash;getting ready.  But,
Grace&mdash;I'm to have five thousand dollars a year!  Five
thousand!  No more sewing then for Grace, I'm
thinking."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" said Grace, smiling in her slow way.  "I
think Ma and I would be glad to believe we'd never
have to see a needle again.  <i>She</i> kept me at it.  You
see, Charley, we've been keeping the wolf from the
front door and the kitchen door, while you and Father
were guarding the woodshed."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"  Then suddenly, "You don't
tell me&mdash;you don't mean that&mdash;?  Was <i>that</i> what
made your hands so rough, yours and Mrs. Rawn's
yonder?  What have you got there, Mrs. Rawn&mdash;something
in silk?  Oh, a pair of braces, eh?  For
me?  How nice of you."
</p>

<p>
Grace smiled again.  "I'll be jealous of Ma.  Shall
I go and get my own work to show you?"
</p>

<p>
"You mean for your father, of course&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, no.  Neither Pa nor you can afford silk
embroidered braces, Charles!  I've done six pairs this
week, and Ma&mdash;well Ma must have done a dozen.
She's wonderful."
</p>

<p>
"But what do you mean?" asked the young man,
still puzzled.  Grace said nothing further, but held up
her blackened finger-tips and looked him in the eye.
A blush of comprehension came to his face.
</p>

<p>
"You women!" he exclaimed.  "You've worked as
hard as we did; and we didn't know!"
</p>

<p>
"We had to do something," said Mrs. Rawn quietly.
"I tried a number of things.  We could earn practically
nothing in the sweatshop work.  Grace addressed
envelopes here at home at night, for a while&mdash;but
that's what every other girl in all the city's doing, I
think.  I saw some of these embroidered things in the
window of a men's furnishing shop.  I went in and
told the man I could do them as well as that for
twenty-five cents a pair.  We've had as much as thirty
cents for some of our best ones.  Why, dear me!  I
hadn't done any work in silk for years and years; but
it all came back.  We earned quite a bit here.  It kept
the table."
</p>

<p>
"My God!" said Halsey.  "And I've been eating here!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
"It was our part," said Laura Rawn.  "It was all
we could do.  A woman just has to do the best she
can, you know.  Well, we helped."
</p>

<p>
"A woman has to do the best she can," repeated
Laura Rawn gently, seeing that this left Halsey
awkward.  "If she's a true woman, she tries to help.  I
want that Grace should always think of it in just that
way."
</p>

<p>
That, it seemed, was the foolish philosophy of
Laura Rawn; a philosophy not often written on the
docket of divorce courts, to be sure.  Perhaps it
is&mdash;or once was&mdash;inscribed on dockets elsewhere.

CHAPTER I
<br />
THE NEW MR. RAWN
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Some wise man has said that a man changes
entirely each seven years of his life, becoming
wholly different in every portion, particle and atom of
his bodily bulk and losing altogether what previously
were the elements, parts, portions or constituent
molecules which made himself.  So much as to the
physical body.  In respect of epochal changes in a man's
character we may wholly approve the dictum of the
philosopher, though perhaps not agreeing to any
specific seven-years period.  Thus, in the case of John
Rawn, the first stage of his career, in which he lived
without any very great alteration, occupied some seven
and forty years.  Yet it was a wholly different John
Rawn who, at forty-eight, found himself seated at the
vast and shining desk of the president of the
International Power Company, in the city of Chicago.  The
past was so far behind him that he could not with the
utmost mental striving reconstruct the picture of it.
He was a wholly new, distinct and different man.  The
old and deadly days were gone.  There never had been
such a place as Kelly Row.  Fate had performed its
miracle.  Here was John Rawn, where alone he ever
could have belonged&mdash;in a place of power.
</p>

<p>
Surrounded by a delicious sense of his own fitness
and competence, smug, urbane, well-clad, basking in
the balmy glow of his own glory, exulting in his own
proved ability to conquer fate, John Rawn, on his first
day as chief executive of the International Power
Company, paused for a time and leaned back in his
chair, giving himself over to luxurious imaginings.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
There is no peculiar delight in owning power unless
one may exercise that power.  There being no dog
present which he might kick out of the way, John
Rawn essayed other divertisements.  The harness of
business system was still rather new to him, at least
the harness which pertains to this stage of a business
system.  He was happily unaware that he was a lay
figure here, with few actual duties beyond those of
looking impressive&mdash;happily ignorant that shrewder
and more skilled minds than his had seen to it that
his official duties should be few and well hedged about.
He had not as yet ever worked at a desk blessed with
a row of push buttons, and was ignorant as yet, and
very naturally, in regard to the particular function of
each of these several buttons whose mother of pearl
faces now confronted him.  Resolving to take them
seriatim, he pushed the one farthest to the right;
which, as it chanced, was the one arranged to call to
him his personal stenographer.
</p>

<p>
The door opened silently.  John Rawn, looked up
and saw standing before him a young woman whom
he had never seen before.  "I beg pardon, Madam,"
said he, half rising.  "I didn't know you were there.
How did&mdash;is there anything I can do for you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am the stenographer assigned for your work,
Mr. Rawn, until you shall have concluded your own
arrangements in the office," answered the young woman.
Her voice was even and well controlled, her enunciation
perfect.  She was not in the least confused over
this <i>contre-temps</i>, else had the self-restraint not to
notice it.  She stood easily, note-book in hand, with no
fidgeting, in such fashion that one must at once have
classified her as a well-poised human being.
</p>

<p>
Or, again, one might have said that here was a
very beautiful human creature.  She was almost tall,
certainly and wholly shapely; young, but fully and
adequately feminine; womanly indeed in every well
curved line.  Her hands and feet, her arms&mdash;the latter
now disclosed by half sleeves&mdash;all were of good modeling.
Her hair, piled up in rather high Grecian coiffure
and confined by a bandeau of gold-brocaded ribbon, was
perhaps just in the least startling.  But you might not
have noticed that with disapproval had you seen the
shining excellence of the hair itself, brown, either
dark or blonde as the light had it.  Her forehead was
oval, her chin also oval, the curve of the cheek running
gently into the chin like the bow moulding of a racing
yacht.  Her teeth were even and brilliant, her lips well
colored, her eyes large and just a trifle full, with thin
lids, and in color blue; as you might have said with
hesitation, just as you might have been uncertain
regarding the blondness of her hair.  Over the eyes
the brows were straight, brown, well-defined.  Her
nose&mdash;since one must particularize in all such intimate
matters&mdash;was a trifle thin, high in the bridge; thus
completing what lacked, if anything, to convey the
aspect of a woman aristocratic, reserved and dignified.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Virginia Delaware, Mr. Rawn's personal stenographer,
was born the daughter of a St. Louis baker.
She had, however, passed through that epoch of her
development and by some means best known to herself
and her family, had attained a good education,
ended by three years in a young ladies' finishing school
in the East.  By what process of reasoning she had
considered that this was the proper field for her ambitions,
is something which need not concern us.  She was
here; and as she stood thus, easy, beautiful,
competent, she was as much a new and different Virginia
Delaware from the Virginia Delaware of seven years
earlier date as was this new John Rawn different
from the old.  The world moves.  Especially as to
American girls does it move.
</p>

<p>
"I am the stenographer assigned to you, Mr. Rawn,
until you shall have concluded your own arrangements."  She
spoke very quietly.  Rawn recovered himself quickly.
</p>

<p>
"I was just about to say," he went on, "that I
intended to have the boy get my car ready.  Would you
tell him to have it at the door in fifteen minutes?  Then
come back.  There are one or two little letters."
</p>

<p>
A few moments later the young woman was seated
at a small table near the end of the desk.  Without
any nervousness she awaited his pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"I'll trouble you for that newspaper, if you don't
mind, Miss&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Delaware."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss Delaware.  Thank you!"
</p>

<p>
He glanced down the columns of the market reports.
"Take this," he said, turning to the young woman.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Chandler and Brown, Brokers, City.  Dear Sirs:
Sell me two hundred Triangle Rubber at three forty.
Yours truly."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She was up with him before he had finished his
first official act.  He turned again:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Kitter, Moultrie &amp; Johnson, Bakersfield, California.
Gents: Cinch all the Guatemala shares you can at eight
cents and draw on me if you need any money.  Yours
truly."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mr. Rawn could not think of anything else.  Few
details had been allowed to reach his desk.  He was
the last sieve in a really well-arranged series of
business screens.  But even in this brief test he had a
feeling that the new stenographer would prove efficient.
In three or four minutes more he was yet better
assured of that fact; for before he could find his coat
and hat she entered gently and laid the completed
letters on his desk:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Messrs. Chandler and Brown, 723 Exchange
Building, Chicago: Gentlemen: Please sell for my
account two hundred (200) shares Triangle Rubber,
at three hundred and forty dollars ($340) or the
market, obliging, Yours very truly."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Messrs Kitter, Moultrie &amp; Johnson, Bakersfield,
California.  Gentlemen: Please buy for my account
all the Guatemala Oil which you can pick up at eight
cents (8c).  You are at liberty to draw on me as you
require funds.  Allow two points margin.  Yours very
truly."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Very good," said Mr. Rawn.  A slight perspiration
stood on his forehead.  The young woman silently
disappeared.  "Two points!" said Mr. Rawn.  "By Jove!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rawn remained well assured of several things.
First, that he was going to make sixty-eight thousand
dollars out of the Triangle Rubber shares, which had
been given him practically as a present, or as "bonus,"
or as tribute, by Standley and Ackerman and their
friends at the inception of the International Power
Company; second, that he might perhaps make a
quarter of a million out of his inside knowledge
derived from these same sources, regarding plans in
Guatemala Oil; third, that his new stenographer
seemed to have a good head, and was not apt to be
forward.
</p>

<p>
Whereupon, having concluded his first wearying
day's labor, Mr. Rawn donned his well-cut overcoat
and shining top hat, and with much dignity passed out
the private door of his office.  The elevator was
crowded with common people, among them, several
persons of the lower classes.  Mr. Rawn felt that the
president of a great corporation like International
Power ought by all rights to have an elevator of his
own.  This conviction of the injustice wrought upon
presidents was so borne in upon him that, when he
stepped up to the long and shining car which the
chauffeur held at the curb, his face bore a severe
frown and his lower lip protruded somewhat.  Feeling
thus, he rebuked the chauffeur, who touched his
hat.
</p>

<p>
"You kept me waiting!" said John Rawn, glowering.
"I wait for no one."
</p>

<p>
The chauffeur touched his hat again.  "Very good,
sir.  If you please, where shall I drive?"
</p>

<p>
"Take me to the National Union Club," growled
Mr. Rawn.  Already it may easily be seen that one of
Mr. Rawn's notions of impressing the world with his
importance was to be rude to his servants&mdash;a not
infrequent device among our American great folk.
</p>

<p>
The chauffeur touched his hat once more and
sprang to his seat after closing the door of the car.  In
a few minutes Mr. Rawn was deposited at the wide
stairway of one of the most estimable clubs of the city;
where his name had been proposed by members of
such standing in the railway and industrial world that
the membership committee felt but one course open
to them.
</p>

<p>
A boy took his hat and coat, following him presently
with a check into a wide room, well furnished with
great chairs and small tables.  Rawn stood somewhat
hesitant.  He knew almost nobody.  Moreover, his
club frightened him, for it was his first, and it differed
largely from Kelly Row.  A fat man in one group
gathered about a small table recognized him and came
forward to shake his hand.  "Join us, Mr. Rawn?"
he asked.  Some introductions followed, then another
question, relative to the immediate business in hand.
</p>

<p>
"You may bring me a Rossington," said Mr. Rawn,
with dignity, "but please do not have too much orange
peel in it."  He spread his coat tails with perhaps
unnecessary wideness as he pushed back into the great
chair.  You or I might not have had precisely his air
in precisely these surroundings, but John Rawn had
methods of his own.
</p>

<p>
"I've never liked too much orange peel," said he
gravely, putting the tips of his fingers together.  "The
last time, I thought they had just a trace too much.
A suspicion is all I ever cared for."
</p>

<p>
They listened to him with respect.  As a matter of
fact, Mr. Rawn had never tasted alcoholic beverages
of any sort whatever until within the year last past.
All the better for his physique, as perhaps one might
have said after a glance at these pudgier forms
adjacent to him now.  All the better, too, for his nerves.
But it is not always the case that the beginner in
alcohol can drink less than one of ancient acquaintance
therewith; the reverse is often true.  In John
Rawn's system strong drink produced only a somber
glow, a confident enlargement of his belief in his own
powers.  It never brought levity, mirth, flippancy
into his demeanor.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
His acquaintances saw now in Mr. Rawn, the last
member received into their august affiliations, a man
of breeding, long used to good things in life, and
trained to a nice discrimination.  Perhaps the fact that
he was the new president of the new International
Power Company, a concern capitalized at many millions
and reputed to have one of the best things going,
may have brought added respect to the attitude of
some of those who sat about the little table.  Thus,
one passed a gold cigarette-box; yet another proffered
selections from divers cigars, of the best the club
could provide; which was held thereabouts to be the
best that any club could provide.
</p>

<p>
"I was just telling Mason, here, when you came in,
Rawn," said the large man who had risen to greet
him, "that at last it looks as though that jumping-jack,
Roosevelt, was down and out for good.  I always said
he'd get his before long.  Good God!  When you stop
to think about it, hasn't he been a menace to the
prosperity of this country?"
</p>

<p>
"He certainly has been, the everlasting butter-in,"
ventured a by-sitter.
</p>

<p>
"In my belief," said Rawn solemnly, "he hasn't the
ghost of a show for the nomination&mdash;not the ghost of
a show!"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," assented the large man.  "He's
been politically repudiated in his own state and city
for years, and now it's just soaking into the heads of
western men that he won't do.  He's been the Old
Man of the Sea on all kinds of business development.
In my belief, half the labor troubles in this country
are traceable to him&mdash;anyhow to him and the
confounded newspapers that keep stirring things up.
Progress!  If these progressives had their way, I
reckon we'd all be progressing backwards, that's where
we'd be.  Look at all these new men, too!  It makes
me sick to think how our Senate is changing."  He
spoke of "our" Senate with a fine proprietary air.
</p>

<p>
"But there is talk that Roosevelt'll run again," said
another speaker, reaching for his second cocktail.
</p>

<p>
"No chance!" said the large man, who had had his
second.  "This whole fool movement for unsettling
business is going to come to an end.  There never was
a time when unsuccessful people were not discontented.
Let the people growl if they like.  They
haven't got any reason.  Talk's cheap.  Let 'em talk."
</p>

<p>
"Money talks best," ventured John Rawn oracularly,
nodding his head.  The others solemnly assented
to this very original proposition.
</p>

<p>
"The business of this country," went on the large
man, "has got nothing to do with Teddy's ten
commandments."
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt," said John Rawn, "that
Mr. Roosevelt has, as you say, been the most disturbing
cause in the unsettling of labor conditions all over the
country.  I've been following his speeches.  He's
always putting out that same old foolish doctrine about
the equality of mankind&mdash;a doctrine exploded long
ago.  It's nothing short of criminal to talk that way
to the lower classes to-day&mdash;it only makes them more
unhappy.  What's the use in misleading the laboring
man and making him think he's going to get something
he can't get?  I tell you, I believe that at heart
Roosevelt is a Socialist.  Anyhow, he's a stumbling-block
to the progress of this republic.  Why, in our own
factory&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're right," interrupted the first speaker.
"Absolutely right.  That sort of talk means ruin to the
country.  I'd like to know what all the men that make
up these labor unions would do if we were to shut
down all the mills and factories and offices&mdash;where'd
they get any place to work if we didn't give it to them?
Yet they bite the very hand that feeds them."
</p>

<p>
"It sometimes looks as though we'd lost almost the
whole season's work in the Senate," gloomily
contributed another of the group.  "We've got the tariff
framed up to suit us, but how long will it last?  Besides,
what's the use of a tariff, if we're going to have
strikes that practically are riots and revolutions, all
over the country?  Our laboring men are not willing
to work.  That's the trouble, I tell you&mdash;all this
foolishness about the brotherhood of man.  Oh, hell!"
</p>

<p>
"You have precisely my attitude, my friend," said
John Rawn, turning to him gravely.  "Precisely.  I
have always said so."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
They all nodded now gravely as they sipped their
second or third cocktails.  Here and there a face grew
more flushed, a tongue more fluent.  The large man,
colder headed, presently turned to Mr. Rawn.
</p>

<p>
"By the way, Rawn," said he, "I hear it around
the street all the time that you've got about the best
thing there is going&mdash;this International Power.  What's
the meaning of all this talk, anyhow?  It's leaking out
that you're going to revolutionize the business world
with all this power-producing scheme of yours.  Some
crazy newspaper child got lit up the other day and
printed a fake story about your plan of running wires
from the river over to Chicago!  Anything in
that?&mdash;but of course there isn't."
</p>

<p>
"Not as you state it," said John Rawn.  "We have
a very desirable proposition, however, in our belief."
</p>

<p>
&mdash;"Say yes!" broke in the smaller man across the
table.  "But it looks like you've got the Ark of the
Covenant concealed, you keep it so close.  None of the
stock seems to get out.  You haven't listed anything,
and nobody can guess within a million dollars what a
share is worth."
</p>

<p>
"No," said John Rawn sententiously, "you couldn't.
I couldn't, myself.  I couldn't yet guess large enough."
</p>

<p>
"But they tell me it's reviving commerce all up and
down the river&mdash;in the old towns."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rawn nodded assentingly, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Newspaper story was that there was going to be
some fly-by-night, over-all, free-for-all <i>wireless</i>
transmission, and all that!  I say, that was deuced good
market work, wasn't it!  We all want in on that
killing when it comes.  But how are we going to get in on
the killing if there isn't any stock to be had, and if it
isn't listed so the public can be got in?"
</p>

<p>
"Standley and Ackerman got the lion's share,"
grumbled the large man, explanatorily.
</p>

<p>
"Did they?" smiled John Rawn, showing his teeth
a trifle.
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course that's the talk&mdash;I don't know
anything about how the facts are.  But when the time
comes, let us in."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said Rawn easily.  "But we're not
saying much just yet, of course.  Just beginning."
</p>

<p>
"But now, was there anything in that crazy fool's
newspaper story?"
</p>

<p>
"We're working on that idea," Rawn admitted, still
smiling.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
They threw themselves back in their chairs and
joined in a burst of laughter.  "You're a wonder,
Rawn!" said the large man admiringly.
</p>

<p>
The second cocktail had served to steady John
Rawn.  "Why?" he inquired evenly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, according to that story, every one of us
manufacturers would be put out of business.  We'd
literally have to come and feed from your hand when
we wanted power, according to that."
</p>

<p>
"It would figure that way on one basis," admitted
Rawn.  "That <i>would</i> be something, wouldn't it?
Almost rather."
</p>

<p>
"Almost rather!" repeated the small man.  "I say,
that's pretty good, isn't it?  Well now, I'll tell you
what; we'd almost rather you'd let us in on the ground
floor, m'friend!  No more coal bills, no more walking
delegates, no more strikes, no more Roosevelt 'n
LaFol't!  Just touch button.  Too bad, Rawn, you
didn't go into fiction yourself&mdash;it must have been you
'nvented that newspaper story, o' course."
</p>

<p>
"You have another guess," said John Rawn.  "But
you haven't guessed big enough yet.  I told you, I
myself couldn't guess big enough."
</p>

<p>
The large man laughed, reached into his pocket and
handed out a bunch of keys.  "Take 'em along," said
he.  "I might as well give you the key to my office,
also to my home&mdash;and maybe one or two others."  Some
smiled at this last remark.
</p>

<p>
"My keys against yours," said John Rawn keenly.
"You can take everything I've got if the time doesn't
come when our company will do everything you're
laughing at now.  But we're not after our friends.
Why couldn't we get together&mdash;and together get the
public?"
</p>

<p>
"Fine!  <i>Now</i> you converse," smiled the large man.
</p>

<p>
"I don't deny I've got an idea up my sleeve, and
have had," continued Rawn.  "I don't deny that we
may make some tremendous changes in business
methods.  When you tell me we can't do these things,
that my idea won't make good, and all that, why, you
almost make me talk.  Not that I'm a talking man.
But International Power isn't after its friends.
</p>

<p>
"But I'm just starting home now," he concluded.
"I only dropped in for a moment.  We're just getting
things begun and I'm rushed day and night.  I'm
rather a new man here in town as yet.  But I'll see you
often."
</p>

<p>
"The central offices will be here, then?" inquired
the large man.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, our main headquarters will be here for a
time."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, joy!  I'll drop in some time and have you do
me up a choice line of philosopher's stones, so that I
can turn things into gold.  Why pay rent?"  The large
man laughed largely.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, all right," rejoined Rawn, also laughing.  "But
our invention is not so very wonderful.  The only
wonder is, that 't hasn't been thought of before.
Nothing is wonderful, you know."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!  I'm just going to come in with you
there," assented the last speaker, suddenly sitting up
in his chair.  "There isn't anything stranger in the
world than things that happen right along, every day.
Look here."
</p>

<p>
He pulled out of his waistcoat pocket some blue
strips of paper.  "Tickets to the Aviation Meet.
Fifty-cent gate.  What do you see?  Why, you see men
doing what men couldn't have been supposed to do a
little while ago.  It's easy now&mdash;and they do that&mdash;they
really fly.  I tell you, fellows, when you get about four
drinks in you and begin to think, this ain't just the
world our daddies knew; and if it ain't, what sort of
world is it going to be that our sons will know?"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely," assented John Rawn, with affability.
"For instance, I'm going out now to take my car home.
Nobody wonders at that.  What would we all have
thought of such speed ten or twelve years ago?  Speed,
gentlemen, speed&mdash;and power!  The man who has
those has got the world in the hollow of his
hand."  With a nod, half negligent, he turned away.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ave C√¶sar!</i>" irreverently remarked a man with a
gray mustache as Rawn passed toward the cloak room.
</p>

<p>
"He sets me thinking, just the same," commented
the large man grumblingly.  "That fellow's a comer.
He's building him a fine place, up the North Shore,
they tell me.  His family must have had money, 'though
it's odd, I never heard of him till just lately.  Who's
going to pay for his house?  Why, maybe we are!"
</p>

<p>
"Believe I'll go home for dinner to-night myself.
Haven't been home for three days," yawned one.
</p>

<p>
&mdash;"And nights," added a smiling friend.
</p>

<p>
"Naturally.  But let's have another little drink.  I'm
telling you, fellows, that fellow Rawn has got me
guessing, too."

GRAYSTONE HALL

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
Mr. Rawn's long and shiny car was waiting for
him when he stepped with stately dignity down
the broad stair of the National Union Club.  His
chauffeur once more touched his hat, as he saw the
hat of Mr. Rawn, so much taller and shinier than his
own.
</p>

<p>
Threading its path through the crowded traffic of
the side streets, the car presently turned up the long
northbound artery of the great western city.
Surrounded by a large and somewhat vulgar throng of
similarly large and shiny cars, it floated on, steadily,
almost silently, until most of the noises and the odors
of the city were left behind; until at last the blue of
the great lake showed upon the right hand through
ranks of thin and straggling trees, supported by a thin
and sandy soil.  Now appeared long rows of mansions,
fronting on the lake, their amusingly narrow and
inadequate grounds backing out upon the dusty roadway
with its continual traffic of long, shiny and ofttimes
vulgar cars.  Miles of cars carried hundreds of men to
miles of mansions.  In less than an hour, from town
to home, John Rawn also pulled up at the entrance to
his home.  Speed limits are not for such as Mr. Rawn.
This residence, yet another of these pretentious
mansions, top-heavy on its inadequate delimitations,
and done by one of the most ingenious architects to
be found for money, was as new, as hideous, as
barbarous as any that could be found in all that long
assemblage of varied proofs of architectural aberrations.
It was as new as Mr. Rawn himself.  The brick walks
were hardly yet firmly settled, the shrubs were not yet
sure of root, the crocus rows in the borders still showed
gaps.  Large trees, transplanted bodily, still were sick
at heart in their new surroundings.  The gravel under
the new <i>porte coch√™re</i> still was red and unweathered.
As to the house itself, it combined Japanese, Colonial
and Elizabethan architecture in nice modern proportions,
the architect having been resolved to earn his
fee.  Many who passed that way turned and pointed
approving thumbs at the residence of Mr. John Rawn,
president of the International Power Company, a new
man who had come in out of the West, and who
evidently was possessed of wealth and taste.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rawn knew that many occupants of other cars
were noting him.  His dignity was perfect as he left
his car, not noticing that the chauffeur once more
touched his hat.  His dignity remained unbroken as
he walked up the Elizabethan steps, flanked by
Japanese jars, and paused at the Colonial door.  The door
swung open softly.  His dignity was such that he
scarcely saw the man who took his coat and hat, and
who received no greeting from his master.  Calm, cold
and scornful, as one well used to such surroundings,
he passed through the long central halls and stood
before the doubly glazed French window whose wide
expanse fronted upon the lake.  He came from inland
parts, and he enjoyed this lake view he had bought.
He did not hear the quiet footfall which approached
over the heavy rug.  Laura Rawn needed to speak to
him the second time.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said he, turning and sighing, "how's everything?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, John."
</p>

<p>
"Not so bad, eh?"  He jerked a thumb to indicate
the lake.
</p>

<p>
"It's grand!" said his wife, yet with no vast
enthusiasm in her tone.
</p>

<p>
"I should say it was grand!  Anyhow, there's nothing
grander around Chicago.  There's not very much
here in the way of scenery.  Of course, in New
York&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't let us talk of New York, John."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how I could stand anything bigger or
grander than this."
</p>

<p>
"Stand anything more?  Ha-hum!  Well, that's just
about what I expected you to say, Laura.  Sometimes
I wonder if there ever was a man more handicapped
than I am.  Look at this!  What have I done for you?
Why, I changed your whole life for you, as much as
though you'd died and been born into another world.
You couldn't have had all this if it hadn't been for me.
You don't enjoy it.  You've got no use for it.  I don't
set even this for my limit.  I've got ambition, and I'm
going up as far as a man can go in this country.  If
that means New York, all right, when the time comes.
But what does my wife say?  'Oh, I couldn't stand
that!'  Stand it&mdash;why, I half believe, Laura, you wish
you were back in Kelly Row right now&mdash;I believe
that's right where you'd be this minute, if you had
your choice."
</p>

<p>
"I would, John; if things could be the way they
once were."
</p>

<p>
He only growled as he turned away petulantly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I want to see you do well, get ahead,
John, as far as ever you can go.  And of course you'd
never be happy to go back there again."
</p>

<p>
"Happy?&mdash;me&mdash;Kelly Row?  You'd see John Rawn
dead and buried first!  I'd go jump in the lake if I
thought I'd ever have to live again the way we used
to."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder how they are doing back there now,"
said Mrs. Rawn, in spite of all, as though musing with
herself.  "It's evening now, and the men are just
coming home from work.  I wonder if Jane English, next
door to us, has another baby this year.  She always
had, you know.  And there's the young woman, Essie
Hannigan, who always used to wait on the steps for
her husband.  And the dogs; and the babies in the
street.  And the little trees without very many leaves
on them&mdash;why, John, I can see it all as plain as if it
were right here.  This house of ours here is so grand
I can't understand it.  How did we get it, John?&mdash;when
we worked so long, so many years, and lived just like
those others there?  It all came at once.  Have you
earned all this&mdash;in a year or so?  And how did you
get it almost finished, before we moved up here, while
we still were living in St. Louis&mdash;without either of
us being here to watch the carpenters?"
</p>

<p>
"I did it with <i>money</i>, Laura, that's how.  If you
have money you can get anything done you want; and
you don't have to do it with your own hands.  But
don't say 'carpenters'&mdash;it was an <i>architect</i> built this
house."
</p>

<p>
"It cost a <i>lot</i> of money!"
</p>

<p>
"Not so much&mdash;I've not got in over two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars yet, even with most of the
furnishings in."
</p>

<p>
"You're always joking nowadays, John.  Of course,
you haven't made that much."
</p>

<p>
"Well, no; that's a lot of money to take out of the
investments of a beginner.  I had to get accommodation
for three-fourths of it."
</p>

<p>
"Accommodation?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, mortgage, then&mdash;that's what they'd call it in
Texas or Kelly Row.  I couldn't tie up all my
capital&mdash;that isn't business.  But what does it amount to?
My salary is a hundred thousand a year; and I'm
making more than that on the side.  I didn't propose to
come up here, president of the International Power
Company, and go to living in a six-room flat.  I wanted
a <i>house</i>.  You see."  He swept a wide gesture again.
</p>

<p>
"It's not much like our little seven-room house in
the brick block, is it, John?"
</p>

<p>
"And you wish you were back there?  That's fine,
isn't it?  How can I do things for you if that's the way
you feel?  You've never got into the game with me,
Laura,&mdash;you've never helped me; I've had to do it all.
Yet look what I've done in the last two or three years!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, John, I know I couldn't do much."
</p>

<p>
"You didn't do <i>anything</i>!  You don't do anything
now!  You don't try to go forward, you never <i>did</i> try,
you always hung back!  You've always thought of
your own selfish pleasure, Laura, and that's the
trouble with you.  A man busy all day with large matters,
who comes home tired and worn out, looks for a little
help when he gets home.  What do I hear?  'I wish I
was back in Kelly Row!'  Fine, isn't it?  I'll bet you
a million dollars there isn't another woman in Chicago
that would feel the way you do.  You ought at least
to have some sense of gratitude, it seems to me."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Grieved at the injustice of life, Mr. Rawn turned
his troubled face and gazed out over the unexpressive
expanse of water.  Laura Rawn said nothing at the
time, being a woman of large self-control.  At length
she laid a gentle hand upon her husband's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Why, John," said she, "I'd go to New York, if it
was for the best.  You ought to know that I have your
interests at heart&mdash;really, you ought to know that,
John.  I don't want to hinder you, not the least in the
world, John."
</p>

<p>
"But you <i>do</i> hinder me.  You make me feel as
though you were not in the game with me, that you
were holding back all the time.  I'm going a fast gait.
I'm a rising man; but you ought to be in my company.
A man doesn't like to feel that he's all alone in the
world!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, John!  Why, <i>John</i>!"
</p>

<p>
But he never caught the poignant anguish of her
tone.  "Why don't people come here to see you?" he
demanded.  "It's like a morgue.  And by the time this
place is done it'll cost pretty near another quarter of
a million."
</p>

<p>
"John!" she gasped.  "Where will you get it?"
</p>

<p>
He turned and waved at her an aggressive finger.
"I made it!" said he, "and I'll make it.  I made a clean
sixty-eight thousand dollars, to-day, with a turn of my
wrist.  I'll make the price of this house in another two
years, if all goes well.  When it starts, it comes fast.
There's nothing grows like money.  It rolls up like a
snowball&mdash;for a few men; and I'm one of the few!
It's easy picking for strong men in the business world
of America to-day&mdash;the game's framed up for them,
when they get in.  And one of these days I'm going
in further.  We'll see a life which will make all
this"&mdash;he swept a wide hand about him&mdash;"look like
thirty cents."  His pendulous lower lip trembled in
emotion, precisely as might that of his father have
trembled when he addressed assembled and unrepentant
gatherings of sinners.
</p>

<p>
"Well, John," said Laura Rawn, dropping into a
chair and crossing her hands in her lap, "you've done
a lot for me, that's sure, more than I have had any
right in the world to expect.  I can't do much.  I'm
only going to try just all I can to keep up with you.
But now let's not bother or worry any more about
things.  Supper is just about ready."
</p>

<p>
"Dinner, you mean.  <i>Dinner</i>, Mrs. Rawn!"
</p>

<p>
She flushed a trifle.  "As I meant, dinner, yes.  You'll
have time to dress for dinner, if you like, but I wish
you wouldn't, John.  I don't mean to.  The truth is, I
had the cook make to-night something you used to be
very fond of in the old days&mdash;a pot roast&mdash;shoulder
of pork with cabbage.  Somehow, it seemed to me that
we wouldn't want to dress up just for that, John."
</p>

<p>
"My God, no!"  The suffering John Rawn fell into
a chair and dropped his face between his hands,
shaking his head from side to side.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it all right, John?" she asked anxiously
"What else should I get?"
</p>

<p>
"Leave it to the cook, Laura&mdash;I mean the chef.
That's what he's <i>paid</i> for.  Is there anything too good
for us?"
</p>

<p>
"Not for you, John.  But I sometimes think," she
went on slowly after a while, "that I'm not entitled to
so much as we have, when others have so little&mdash;the
same sort of people that we once were.  I don't
understand it.  I don't see where we <i>earned</i> it.  Why, back
there where we came from, life is very likely just as
hard as it ever was."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't <i>earned</i> it!" gasped John Rawn&mdash;"I haven't
<i>earned</i> it?  Well, listen at that, to my face!  Well, I'd
like to ask you, Laura, if I haven't earned this, what
man ever <i>did</i> earn his money?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't take me wrong, John dear.  I was just
wondering how anybody could ever earn so much."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't get the habit of wondering."
</p>

<p>
"I like my things," said she softly, gazing about her.
"I've always wanted nice things, of course.  I never
thought we'd have a place like this.  Then the trees,
and the lake&mdash;why, it's like fairyland to me!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
But Rawn turned a discontented face around at the
ill-assorted furnishings of Graystone Hall&mdash;as he had
named his quasi-country place.  As in the case of the
architect, the house decorator and furnisher had had
full license, and each had done his worst.
</p>

<p>
"Somehow these things don't seem just the way they
are down at the club!" he grumbled.  "I've been at
other houses along in here, once in a while, and somehow
our things don't seem just like theirs.  It's not my
fault.  Surely you must see how busy I am all the
time&mdash;I've not got the time to take care of household
matters, too."
</p>

<p>
He got up and took a turn or so about, gazing with
dissatisfaction at his household goods.  "They tell me
that J. Pierpont Morgan picks up what they call
collector's pieces.  I've heard that lots of the big men
have in their houses these collector's pieces.  We've
got to have some of them here.  It won't do to have
them say of us that we're anything back of Morgan or
anybody else.  If they think that of me, they don't
know John Rawn."
</p>

<p>
"Dinner is served, Mrs. Rawn," said a low voice at
the farther side of the room.  The butler stood
respectful, at attention.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mrs.</i> Rawn!" grumbled the master of the place.
"I'll train him different!  Why don't he tell <i>me</i>?"
</p>

<p>
They passed into the wide dining-room, the butler
now silently drawing together the double curtains
which covered the windows fronting the lake.  Rawn
seated himself frowningly at the table, with the
customary grumbling comment which he used to conceal
his own lack of ease.  In truth, he had never yet
enjoyed a meal in his great house, and would at this
moment have been far more comfortable in his shirt
sleeves at the little table in Kelly Row, with the
nearest butler a thousand miles away for all of him.  The
presence of this shaven, priest-like personage behind
him always sent a chill up his spine.  He half jumped
now as that icy individual coughed at his side, poured
a little wine into his first glass, and passed on to
Mrs. Rawn.  Laura Rawn declined, as was her custom, and
the butler turned to fill his master's glass.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to drink wine, Laura," said the owner
of Graystone Hall, regardless of the butler's presence.
"Practically all the women do, I notice.  Some
smoke&mdash;cigarettes, I mean; not a corn-cob pipe.  But then&mdash;" he
raised his own glass and drained it at a gulp.  The
butler filled it again, and passed silently in quest of the
beginnings of the banquet whose <i>pi√®ce de r√©sistance</i>
had caused him and the second maid to exchange wide
grimaces of mirth beyond the door.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
It could not have been called a wholly happy family
gathering, this at Graystone Hall.  Indeed, it lacked
perhaps three generations, possibly three aeons, of
being happy.
</p>

<p>
With little more speech after the evening meal than
they had had before, an hour, perhaps, was passed
in the room which the architect called the library,
Mrs. Rawn called the parlor, and Mr. Rawn called the gold
room.  Then Laura Rawn, as was her wont, passed silently
up-stairs to her own apartments&mdash;or her bedroom,
as she called it&mdash;widely removed, in the architect's
plans, from those of her husband.  One room, one
couch, had served for both in Kelly Row.
</p>

<p>
The gray lake throbbed along its shore.  Night came
down and softened the ragged outlines of the scrawny
trees which stood sentinels along the front of this pile
of stone and steel and concrete and wood, which paid
men had striven so hard to render into lines of
home-likeness.  A soft wind passed, sighing.  The lights of
Graystone Hall went out, one by one, while the
evening still was young.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
THE COMPETENCIES OF MISS DELAWARE
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Two-thirds of the inhabitants of this world
live in that unreal atmosphere best described by
the vulgar word of "bluff."  About one-half the other
third know that fact.  The first two-thirds, not being
able to determine which that latter half may be,
exist in continual fear that they may guess wrongly in
these vulgar fractions, and so make pretense where
pretense is of no avail.  Shoddy fears nothing so much
as what vulgarly is called "the real thing;" but the
trouble with shoddy, the anxiety, nay, the agony of
shoddy, bluff, pretense, insincerity, whatever you care
to call it, lies largely in the fact that shoddy can not
always tell when it has been discovered to be shoddy.
</p>

<p>
There did not lack times in John Rawn's social life
when he felt a very considerable trepidation regarding
himself.  He often looked at the tall mansion houses
which he passed on his daily journey to and from his
home, and wondered whether the occupants of some
of them did not live a life of which he was ignorant.
He wondered if, after all, there might not be
something money could not buy.
</p>

<p>
For instance, in regard to those collector's pieces of
which he had heard.  How could they be distinguished
from other and less preferred articles of furnishing?
Since he and his wife lacked judgment in such
matters, what was the remedy?  How could he set matters
right without discovering his own ignorance?  He was
like an Indian, ashamed to learn.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rawn was in an unusually abject mental state,
one morning, some months after he had taken charge
of the headquarters offices of the International Power
Company.  It was not often he had much recourse to
spleen-venting beyond that of the disgruntled man,
who most frequently takes it out on the minor office
force.  By this time he had learned his battery of
buttons, and now he pressed one after the other, in order
that he might express to the entire personnel of the
office staff his personal belief of their unfitness to
exist, let alone to execute business duties in a concern
such as this.
</p>

<p>
He reserved one button for the last&mdash;the one farthest
to the right upon his glass-topped desk.  He knew
what pressure upon that button would bring, and he
felt a curious shrinking, a timidity, when he reflected
upon that fact.  He knew he could cause to stand
before him a vision of calm, cool and somewhat superior
femininity.  In a few short months Mr. Rawn had
learned to trust, to respect and to dread his assistant,
Miss Virginia Delaware.  In fact, it occurred to him at
this very moment that she might perhaps be one of
that half of the other third who can distinguish
between pretense and the actual, between shoddy and
the valid article.
</p>

<p>
Yet though this thought gave him a manner of
chill, there was with it an attendant thought which
caused him to glow with the joy of power.  By simply
dropping his finger, he, John Rawn, could summon
into his presence the figure of a beautiful young
woman&mdash;a woman not yet grown old and gray; a woman
of personal charm; a woman calm, cool and superior.
He stretched his own large limbs, glanced at his
rugged frame, his somewhat lined face in the glass
of the cloak-room door.  He looked upon himself and
saw that he was good; as God looked upon the world
when He made it.  He was of belief that a little gray
hair at the temples was no such bar after all in a man's
appearance.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Rawn had lived a life singularly clean and innocent.
His youth had been gawky, his manhood ignorant.
But now, somehow, somewhere, deep in some unsuspected
corner of his nature, John Rawn felt glowing
something heretofore unknown to him.  He did not
know what it was.  At times it seemed to him he could
see opening out before him a new world of wide and
inviting expanses, a world of warmth and light and
luxury and color; in short, a world as unlike Kelly
Row as you may well imagine, inhabited by beings
wholly different from those obtaining in Kelly Row.
And there, among all these, one....  It is to be seen, in
fact, that the life of the city began to open before John
Rawn.  The soul of the city is woman, as it was the
soul of Rome.  Rawn was learning what hitherto he
had small opportunity to learn.  At times he leaned
back in luxurious realization of the fact that he, John
Rawn, late railway clerk, but born to the purple, could
by a touch upon this certain plate of mother-of-pearl
call before him in reality a vision which sometimes he
saw within his mind.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn reached out and touched the last button
to the right in the row.  She appeared before him
a moment later, silently, as calm, as cool, as unsmiling
and as dignified as was her wont.  Not even the quiver
of an eyelid evinced concern as to what her next duty
was to be.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
In appearance Virginia Delaware might have won
approval from a closer critic than John Rawn.  Her
face really was almost classical in its lines, her poise
and dignity now might have been that of some young,
clean-limbed wood-goddess of old.  She always seemed
unfit for humdrum duties.  Surely she had won the
vast hatred of all her associates, who had experienced
no raise of salaries whatever, under the new r√©gime;
whereas, it was well known that the president's
secretary had had one, two, or perhaps several.  These
others detested all forward and superior persons; as
was their irreverent and wholly logical right.
</p>

<p>
"We have some letters this morning, Miss Delaware,"
began Rawn.  "You couldn't quite take care of
them all, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"We handled all we could, Mr. Rawn, I have
referred a large number to proper department heads,
and answered quite a number.  It seemed better to
refer these for your own action."
</p>

<p>
"Business growing, eh?" said Rawn, turning around
to his desk.  The girl's reply was just properly
enthusiastic for the business:
</p>

<p>
"It's wonderful the mail we get.  Inquiries come
from all over the country.  Yes, indeed, it seems to
grow.  The idea goes like wildfire.  I never knew
anything like it.  When we really have the installations
made, it will be only a question of administration."
</p>

<p>
Venturing nothing further, she seated herself at her
table, book and pencil in hand, ready to begin.  She
did her work with a mechanical steadiness and lack
of personality which might have classified her as
indeed simply a cog in the vast machinery of the
International Power Company.  Rawn had gained facility
in his own work, and had found in himself a real
faculty for prompt decision and speedy handling of
detail.  He went on now smoothly, mechanically, rapidly,
almost forgetful of everything but the series of
problems before him, and forgetting each of these as
quickly as he took up the other.  He cast a look of
unconscious admiration of the girl's efficiency when at
last, finishing, he found her also finished with her part,
and without having caused him delay or interruption.
With no comment now, she took up the finished letters
which had been left for his signature.  Standing
at his side, she literally fed them through the mill of
his desk, taking away one signed sheet as she placed
the other before him, smoothly, impersonally, swiftly.
The work of the morning was beautiful in its
mechanical aspect.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
The business system of "International" was shaking
down into a smooth and easy-running efficiency.  At
the close of this work, Miss Delaware remained wholly
unruffled.  Turning toward her at last, John Rawn felt
that curious old feeling, half made up of chilling
trepidation, half of something quite different.  There
seemed to be something upon his mind, some business
still unfinished.
</p>

<p>
"I was about to say, Miss Delaware," he began at
length, "that I am, as you know, a very busy man."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," she said, evenly and impersonally.
</p>

<p>
"I have so many things to do, you see, that I don't
get much time to attend to little things outside of my
business.  A man's business is a millstone around his
neck, Miss Delaware.  We men of&mdash;ahem!&mdash;of affairs
are little better than slaves."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Rawn," she said gently.  "I can understand
that."
</p>

<p>
"For instance, I don't even know, as long as I
have been here in Chicago, the names of the best firms
of decorators, house furnishers, that sort of thing&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't Mrs. Rawn get about very much, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Rawn unfortunately is not very well.  Also she
has the habit of delaying in such matters.  Then, as I
don't myself have the time to take care of
everything&mdash;why, you see&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her eyebrows were a trifle raised by now.
</p>

<p>
&mdash;"So I was just wondering whether I couldn't avail
myself of your&mdash;your&mdash;very possible knowledge of
these stores&mdash;shops, I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well.  Yes, sir.  But I don't quite
understand&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I want to pick up some collector's pieces for
my home, you see."
</p>

<p>
"Good pieces?  Yes, sir.  Of what sort?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, furniture&mdash;or&mdash;yes&mdash;some china stuff, I
suppose.  Maybe&mdash;er&mdash;some pictures."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  You've not quite finished the decorations of
your new home, Graystone Hall."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know the place?"
</p>

<p>
"Every one knows it, Mr. Rawn.  It is very beautiful."
</p>

<p>
"It ought to be beautiful inside and out.  To be brief
about it, I know I oughtn't to ask an assistant who is
only receiving forty-five dollars a week salary to act
as expert for me in house decoration matters&mdash;that's
entirely outside your business, Miss Delaware.  At the
same time&mdash;"  Miss Delaware checked herself just in
time not to mention the salary figure which Mr. Rawn
had stated.  If her oval cheek flushed a trifle, her long
lashes did not flicker.  This was ten dollars a week
more.  She had herself never once mentioned the
matter of salary.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
"Of course, Mr. Rawn, I'd be willing to do anything
I could," she said.  "I know the city pretty well,
having lived here for some time.  If you would rather
have me use my time in that way, it would be a great
pleasure.  I like nice things myself, though of course
I could never have them.  I've just had to flatten my
nose against the window-pane!"  She laughed, a low
and even little burst of laughter, rippling; the most
personal thing she ever had been guilty of doing in
the office&mdash;then checked herself, colored, and resumed
her perfect calm.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind about your other duties.  Take any
time you like.  Go see what you can find me in this
town."
</p>

<p>
"As in what particular?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, take china.  I shouldn't mind having some
ornamental jars, vases&mdash;that sort of thing, you know."
</p>

<p>
"China's difficult, Mr. Rawn&mdash;one of the most difficult
things into which one can go.  There's a terrible
range in it, you see.  It can be cheap or very expensive,
very grotesque or very beautiful.  There are not many
who know china.  I suppose we mean porcelains?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know.  But what would you suggest, for
instance, for my large central room, which opens out
upon the lake?"
</p>

<p>
"What is the color scheme, Mr. Rawn?"
</p>

<p>
"About everything the confounded builders and
decorators could think of," said Rawn frankly.  "I
think they called it a gray-and-silver motive.  I know
there's something in white, with dark red for the
doors and facings."
</p>

<p>
Miss Delaware sat for a moment, a pencil against
her lip, engaged in thought.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said she at length, "I'm sure almost any of
the good houses would send you up what you liked.
There's everything in accord.  You don't want anything
that will 'swear,' as the phrase goes.  If I were
in your place, I would select a few really good pieces,
and try them in place, in the rooms."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes!  But where'll I get them?  How will I
find them?  That's why&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn, there is really only one good selection
in Oriental porcelains in town to-day.  The large shops
have their art rooms, of course, but they're horrible,
for the most part, although most of our 'best people'
buy there&mdash;because they're fashionable.  There's a
little man on &mdash;&mdash; street.  I just happened to see the
things in his window as I went by one day.  He has
some beautiful pieces."
</p>

<p>
"And beautiful prices?"
</p>

<p>
"Much higher than you would need to pay at any
of the larger places, because these are genuine.  None
of them ever had such pieces as these&mdash;they wouldn't
know them when they saw them.  You must remember,
Mr. Rawn, that if a piece of porcelain were only worth
two dollars a thousand years ago, and it was one, say,
of a thousand others just like it at that time, the loss
by breakage of the other duplicates, and the lowest
kind of compound interest from then till now, would
warrant almost any sort of price you'd care to put on
a real work of art&mdash;one that has come down from so
long a time ago."
</p>

<p>
"You've got a good business head!  You know the
value of interest, and few women do.  Now, all I want
to know is, that I'm not being done.  I don't so much
care about the price.  But has this man anything in
the real goods, and if so, what would you suggest?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
Miss Delaware's answer might have proved a trifle
disconcerting, even to one more critically versed than
her employer.  "In my own taste, Mr. Rawn," she
said judicially, "there is nothing in the world so
beautiful as some of the old Chinese monochromes.  They
come sometimes in the most beautiful pale colors.
There is the <i>claire de lune</i>, for instance&mdash;this little
man has some perfectly wonderful specimens, three or
four, I think; one good-sized jar.  These pale blues
grow on you.  They don't seem so absolutely stunning
at first, but they'll go <i>anywhere</i>; and they are beyond
reproach in decoration.  The pieces I saw are of the
Sung dynasty; so they can't have been made later than
1300.  They came from U-Chon, in the Honan province.
I thought them very fine, and from my acquaintance
with porcelains, I believe them to be genuine
pieces."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Rawn&mdash;he was perspiring rather
freely&mdash;"But I confess I never was very much in love
with Chinese art."
</p>

<p>
"But we owe so <i>much</i> to it, Mr. Rawn," she said
with gentle enthusiasm.  "We learned all we know of
underglaze and overglaze from the Chinese&mdash;the best
of our old English china was not made in England,
but imported from the Orient, as you know.  Chippendale
got many of his own ideas in furniture decorations
from the Chinese, and so did the French&mdash;why,
you'll see Parisian bronzes, ever so old, and you
couldn't tell whether they were made in France or
China.  And <i>old</i>!  The man at this little shop has one
piece which he says certainly was made before the
Christian era.  If I were in your place, however, I
would adhere, say, to the Ming dynasty.  Then you'll
get as low as 1644."
</p>

<p>
"You mean apiece?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, sir," she said gently, not smiling at his
mistake.  "I mean, the Ming dynasty ended in the <i>year</i>
1644."
</p>

<p>
"Of course&mdash;you didn't understand me."  Mr. Rawn
perspired yet more.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;well, at least you'll find some good jars and
vases of that period," continued Miss Delaware.  "For
instance, the Ching period of that dynasty is very rich
in the <i>famille-verte</i>, as the French describe it&mdash;some
splendid apple-greens can be had in this.  Then there's
one piece of that same period, I believe, of the <i>famille-rose</i>.
It's a wonderful thing in egg shell porcelain, and
I don't believe its like can be found to-day in all the
Lake Shore Drive&mdash;or even Drexel Boulevard; and
say what you like, Mr. Rawn, there <i>are</i> fanciers there!
In colors there is nothing to equal some of these fine
old pieces.  I wouldn't, of course, suggest the bizarre
and striking ones, but I'd keep down to the quiet and
solid colors, of some of the old and estimable periods.
I don't know much about art, of course, but I've just
happened to study a little bit into the old porcelains.
I'd like to buy a few&mdash;for <i>somebody</i>!  I couldn't go
very far myself&mdash;when they come at a couple of thousand
dollars apiece, for some of the better examples!"
</p>

<p>
Rawn did not lack in gameness, and no muscle in
his face changed as he nodded.
</p>

<p>
"The main thing is not to make the wrong selection,
Miss Delaware," said he.  "I wish you'd go around
there to-morrow, if you find time, and see if this man
will not send up four or five of his better pieces.  I'll
pass on them then."
</p>

<p>
"You may be sure of one thing, Mr. Rawn," said
Miss Delaware, nodding with emphasis, "they will be
real collector's pieces, and any one who knows about
them will see what they are worth."
</p>

<p>
"All right, then.  You'll be saving me a lot of time
if you'll take care of that, Miss Delaware.  Now
another thing.  As I told you, Mrs. Rawn is ill a great
deal of the time.  I want to make her a little
present&mdash;she must have&mdash;that is to say, I am desirous of
sending her, for her birthday, you know, something
like a ring or a pendant, in good stones.  Could you
drop in at Jansen's and have their man bring me over
something this afternoon&mdash;I'll not have time to get
out, I fear."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Mr. Rawn.  I'll be very glad, if I can be
spared from the office."
</p>

<p>
"That's all, Miss Delaware."
</p>

<p>
She passed out gently, impersonally.  Rawn found
himself looking at the door where she had vanished.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IX
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps an hour later that he re-opened the
door himself in answer to a knock.  Miss Delaware
stood respectfully waiting.  "There is a man from
Jansen's waiting for you, Mr. Rawn," said she.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him to come in," said Rawn.  There rose from
a near-by seat a gray-haired, grave and slender man,
of sad demeanor, who presently removed from his
pocket and spread out upon the glass top of John
Rawn's desk such display of gems as set the whole
room aquiver with light.  Rawn felt his own eyes shine,
his own soul leap.  There always was something in
diamonds which spoke to him.
</p>

<p>
"Ah-hum!" said he, feigning indifference, "some
pretty good ones, eh?"  He poked around among them
with the end of his penholder, as the gray and grave
man quietly opened one paper package after another,
and exposed his wares.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn reached out and pushed the button
farthest to the right in the long row on his desk.  Miss
Delaware came and stood quietly awaiting his
command.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes caught, in the next moment, the shivering
radiance which now flamed on the desk top, as
Rawn poked around among the gems that lay under
the beams of the westering sun which came through
the window.  Rawn turned quickly.  He thought he
had heard a sigh, a sob.
</p>

<p>
Something in the soul of Virginia Delaware leaped!
For the first time her eyes shone with brighter fire;
for the first time she half-gasped in actual emotion.
There was something in diamonds which spoke to her
also!
</p>

<p>
"Essence of power!" said John Rawn calmly, poking
among the gems.  The girl did not answer.  The
salesman coughed gently: "I should say a hundred
and fifty thousand dollars worth there, Mr. Rawn,"
said he respectfully.
</p>

<p>
The man whom he addressed turned to the girl who
stood there, her eyes dilated.  He half smiled.  "They're
lovely!" said Virginia Delaware, in spite of herself,
and now unmasked.  "Absolutely lovely!  I love them!"
</p>

<p>
"Pick out two things there," said John Rawn
sententiously, pushing himself back from the desk.  "I
should say this pendant.  Take a guess at the rings.
What would Mrs. Rawn like; and what would about
suit Mrs. Rawn?"
</p>

<p>
She bent above the desk, her eyes aflame at the
sight of the brilliance that lay before her.  Something
laughed up at her, spoke to her.  Her bosom heaved a
bit.
</p>

<p>
"I should say your choice is excellent, Mr. Rawn,"
said she at length, gently, controlling herself.  "The
pendant is beautiful, set with the emeralds.  See that
chain in platinum&mdash;it is a dear!  It's like a thread of
moonlight, isn't it?  And as for the rings, I'd take this
one, I believe, with the two steel-blue stones."
</p>

<p>
"How much?" said John Rawn, turning to the grave
and gray salesman.
</p>

<p>
"The two pieces would cost you twenty-eight thousand
dollars, sir," the latter replied, gravely and
impersonally.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Delaware," said John Rawn, taking from his
pocket his personal check book, "oblige me by making
out a check for that amount.  Bring it in to me
directly&mdash;and have the boy call my car."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
X
</p>

<p>
When John Rawn ascended the steps of his mansion
house that night, he fairly throbbed with the sense of
his own self-approval.  There was that in his pocket
which, he thought, when worn by the wife of John
Rawn at any public place of display, would indicate
what grade of life he, John Rawn, had shown himself
fit to occupy.  He lost no time in summoning his wife,
and with small adieu put in her extended hand the
little mass of trembling, shivering gems.  She gazed
at them almost stupefied.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well!" he broke out, "can't you say
anything?  What about it?  They're yours."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, John!" she began.  "John!  What do you
mean?  How could you&mdash;how could I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He flung out his hand in a gesture of despair.  "Oh,
there you go again!  Can't you fall into line at <i>all</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"But John!  I've never done anything in all my life
to deserve them, of course.  Besides, I couldn't wear
them&mdash;I really couldn't&mdash;I'd be afraid!  And they
wouldn't seem right&mdash;on me!"
</p>

<p>
"You've <i>got</i> to wear them!" he retorted.  "We've
got to go out once in a while if I'm to play this
game&mdash;we've got to go to shows, theaters, operas,
somewhere.  They've got to sit up and say that we've got
some <i>class</i>, Laura, I'm telling you!"
</p>

<p>
"But, John!  How would I look decked out in things
like that?  I'm so plain, common, you know."
</p>

<p>
"That's not the question.  Do you know how much
these cost?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, no&mdash;maybe a thousand dollars, for all I
know!"
</p>

<p>
"A thousand dollars!" groaned Rawn.  "Maybe they
did!  Do you know what I paid for what you've got in
your hand, Laura?  Twenty-eight thousand dollars!
That's all."
</p>

<p>
Impulsively she held out her hand to him.  "Take
them back!" she whispered.  "It isn't right."
</p>

<p>
For one moment he looked at her, and she shrank
back from his gaze.  But Rawn's anger turned to
self-pity.
</p>

<p>
"My own wife won't wear my diamonds," said he.
"This, for a man as ambitious as I am, and a man who
has done as much as I have!"
</p>

<p>
She came now and put her arms about his neck, the
first time in years; but not in thankfulness.  She looked
straight into his eyes.  "John!" she said.  "Oh,
<i>John</i>!"  There was all of woman's anguish in her eyes, in her
voice.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
AT HEADQUARTERS
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
The International Power Company remained a
puzzle in suspended animation before the business
world.  Its campaign, whatever it was, went on behind
closed doors and closed mouths.  The men who were
backing John Rawn were doing so with daring and
courage, yet with business discretion and business
eagerness for results.  There was no leak anywhere,
but the capitalists who were showing their faith in the
basic idea of the company began to grow impatient
because of the slow advancement of the most important
of their plans; those bearing on wireless transmission
from the central generating station on the
Mississippi River.
</p>

<p>
Rawn's duties at the central offices, as president of
the company, although steadily increasing, were still
to very large extent perfunctory matters of routine;
but the president's office evinced very early a singular
efficiency in executive affairs.  Rawn's directors
looked on him with mingled approval and cautiousness,
coming almost to the belief that, if the progress
of the central distributing plant, or "Wireless No. 1,"
as it was known in the company's literature, did not
seem all it should be, at least the president of the
company was not to blame therefor.  They turned to
the department of mechanical installation; which
brought Charles Halsey under investigation.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Halsey and his wife, John Rawn's daughter, had
taken up their residence in the small Chicago suburb
in which the central plant had been located.  Their
cottage was a small one, and it was furnished much
like other cottages thereabout, occupied by salaried
men, mechanics, persons of no great means.  It
retained something of the complexion of the old
quarters in Kelly Row.  The furniture was of imitation
mahogany, the pictures had been, for the most part,
bought by mail, the decorations were a jumble of
inharmonious inadvertencies.  The two young folk, their
means as small as their tastes were undeveloped, gave
themselves small concern over architects' plans and
"collectors' pieces."  They were busy as are most young
couples in the delights of their first experiment in
housekeeping; and Halsey himself now was deep in
the strong and somber delight of developing a beloved
idea.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, Halsey was often taken to the central
offices in the city for conferences with the president of
the company.  He frequently met there Virginia
Delaware, even at times gave dictation to her&mdash;a thing he
never failed to remember, but never remembered to
mention in his own home.  As do many men even in this
divorceful age, he set aside comparisons, forced himself
into loyalty.  Moreover, he yet was very young in
married life, and always had lived in an atmosphere where
man, married or single, coveted not that which was his
neighbor's.  It was but unconsciously, as though moved
only by force of gravitation, that he drifted to Miss
Delaware with his correspondence.  He said to himself
that it was because she was so efficient.  Yes, that was
it, of course, he assured himself, frowning when, once
upon a time, he detected a flush on his face in answer to
a sudden question of his soul.  Thereafter he went not
infrequently to the general offices.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
On one such occasion he found himself in the
position known among salaried workers as being "called
upon the carpet" before "the old man."  Rawn held a
letter in his hand to which he referred as he chided
Halsey for the delays in his department of the work.
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose I can stand for this sort of thing
coming from New York?" he began.  "What's the
matter out there with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Just what we might expect," Halsey replied coolly.
"I've tried to cut down the expenses, but the men
won't take the cut in wages."
</p>

<p>
"Why won't they?"
</p>

<p>
Halsey smiled.  "They have a hundred answers for
that.  One is, that they can't live on the wages, and
another is, that they want the union scale."
</p>

<p>
"They'll never unionize our factory, Mr. Halsey!
If they did, we might as well throw away all our
money and tell them our secret at the start&mdash;we'd be
working for them, not they for us."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, sir.  I think, myself, an open shop
is safer for us.  But the unions make all sorts of
disturbances.  I can't keep on a steady crew; and unless
I do, I have to start in and educate a new set of men
every week, or every day; and I have to be careful
what I let any of them know.  I can't help it, Mr. Rawn."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll <i>have</i> to help it, that's all," Rawn
retorted grimly.  "If the unions want fight they can have
fight, until we get to the place where we can take all
the fight out of them.  These laboring men want to
stop the whole progress of this country&mdash;they're a
drag on the industry of this country, a continuous tax
on all consumers.  I'll show them!  Once we get those
motors installed, I'll make them crawl."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"And yet, do you know, Charles," he went on a little
later, his voice almost trembling, "the <i>injustice</i> of
this conduct is what cuts me.  I've had it in my mind
to <i>do</i> something for the laboring men of this country.
Of course, I've seen all along that the general
introduction of our motors into all sorts of industrial uses
would throw hundreds and thousands of laboring men
out of employment&mdash;put them on the scrap heap
permanently.  What are they going to do then?  Some
one's got to feed them just the same, as you once said
to me, long ago.  You talk about problems!&mdash;Why, we
haven't got to the great ones in this country yet.  The
cost of living certainly will climb when that day comes.
And the scale of wages will go down, when we abolish
the man who has only muscle to sell.  How are they
going to eat?
</p>

<p>
"Now, I've foreseen something of this, and planned
for it.  These people can't plan for themselves, and it's
always got to be some stronger mind that does the
thinking.  You know, I was born in Texas.  I've
always resolved to do something for that state; and, as
I've just told you, I've always had it in mind to do
something for the laboring man&mdash;that is to say, the
man who sees himself just as he really is, and who
doesn't rate himself worth just the same as the
fellow next door to him, so much and no more.
</p>

<p>
"I've had my eye for some time on a tract of land
down in Texas, forty thousand acres.  It shall never
be said of John Rawn that he forgot either his state
or his fellow-man in the time of his success.  When
we get our motors going here&mdash;it will be, of course,
a few years before the full effect of it all is felt&mdash;why
then I'm going to colonize hundreds of these discarded
workmen on this land in Texas.  They can put in their
labor there, where it will be useful, and can produce a
living for themselves and a surplus for others.  In
short, it has been my plan to put them where they
could continue to be useful to society.  I wouldn't want
to see them <i>starve</i>!"  Mr. Rawn's lip quivered at this
thought.  He felt himself to be a very tender-hearted
man.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Halsey grimly, "the Czar of Russia had
some such notion regarding the serfs.  Yet he freed
them eventually."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  They'll be not in the least serfs, but
will simply be men transferred by a higher intelligence
to a plane of life which otherwise they could not
reach&mdash;a plane where they can be of use not only to
themselves but to others."
</p>

<p>
"You're always talking, my son," went on Rawn,
harshly, "about helping your fellow-man, loving him
like a brother&mdash;human equality, and all that sort of
rot.  What have any of <i>you</i> ever really done for each
other, I'd like to know, except to meet up there in
garrets, with lanterns hanging around, and discuss plans
for taking away from stronger men the property they
have accumulated?  Now, I'm not going to take it out
in <i>talk</i>&mdash;I'm going to <i>do</i> something for these people.
I'm going to make Texas the place for my colony,
because I don't want to deprive my native state of the
credit of producing a man who had two big ideas&mdash;cheap
power, and common sense in labor.  There's
two <i>big</i> ideas."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't dare tell the men anything of that," was
Halsey's comment.  "It's hard enough as it is."
</p>

<p>
"No, certainly not.  We'll just go on and take our
chances with these men; and they take their chances
with us.  You have my instructions to discharge any
man who kicks on the wage cut, if he doesn't fire
himself.  The town's full of men with families, who aren't
earning enough to eat.  You can get all the help you
want.  Tell them we're open shop, and if they don't
like it they can do their worst.  Let them bring on
their dynamite, if they want to try that&mdash;they can
have all the fight they want; and I'll stay with it
until I see them crawl."
</p>

<p>
"There's something I don't understand about it,
Mr. Rawn.  The men are very sullen.  The foremen
tell me that they never had so much trouble.  Of
course, they don't understand it themselves, but it's
just as though our secret was getting out, and as if the
men were afraid of cutting their own throats when
they build these machines.  Not that they understand
what it's all about&mdash;it's air tight yet, that's sure."
</p>

<p>
"You begin to see some of the practical results of
your infernal socialistic ideas, don't you, then?  You'll
come to my notion of life after a while."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn, what's the end of that?  What's the
logical conclusion?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll <i>tell</i> you!  One end and logical conclusion
is going to be that I'll get some one to handle that
factory if you can't; and he'll handle it the way I tell
him!"
</p>

<p>
"You want my resignation now?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd very likely take it if it weren't for Grace.
Besides, we've started on this thing together; and
moreover again, I want you, when I go to New York, to
see the directors and explain to them that their
impatience is all wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Is there much dissatisfaction down there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  We've both got to run down East to-morrow
night.  Go on out now, and reserve four compartments
on the limited."
</p>

<p>
"Four?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;we'll want a place to eat and work on the
road.  I've got to take a stenographer along, of course.
Next year I'll have a car of my own."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
Halsey cast a quick glance at him, but still hesitated.
"I don't see how I can well leave Grace right
now," said he.  "It's near her time."
</p>

<p>
"You both take your chances about that," growled
Rawn.  "Business enterprises have to be born, as well
as children.  The important things come first.  The one
important thing for you and me is to get down there
and see those cold-footed Easterners and tell them
where they get off in this business."
</p>

<p>
"Say three days&mdash;maybe I can get back in time,
Mr. Rawn.  But I must say that they're asking us both to
show a good deal of loyalty to this company."
</p>

<p>
"It's the only way to get success&mdash;fidelity to your
employers, no matter what comes.  Of course, I know
how you feel, but business can't wait on women."
</p>

<p>
"A woman doesn't always understand about business,
Mr. Rawn.  They're rather strange things, don't
you think?  Grace doesn't talk much to me&mdash;she never
has.  Sometimes&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Rawn raised a hand.  "Charles, never let me hear
a word of doubt or disloyalty regarding your wife!
No daughter of Grace's parents could be anything but
faithful and worthy.  You should return such loyalty
with love.  Never let anything shake you out of your
duty to your own wife&mdash;my girl Grace."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you say that?  We're married, and we're
happy&mdash;and as you know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  I like to hear you speak in that way.
Always be gentle and kind to your wife.  Of course,
marriage may not seem always as it was in the
honeymoon days, my son."
</p>

<p>
"That's true," said Halsey suddenly.  "Do you know,
I've thought that."
</p>

<p>
"What <i>right</i> had you to think it?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn, Grace is my wife and I love her.  But
I'll confess the truth to you&mdash;she acts as though we'd
been married forty years.  She runs the house well,
but she&mdash;I can't explain to you what I mean.  She
doesn't seem <i>contented</i> any more.  Of course, she loves
me, and of course I love her, and we're married, and
all that; and then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Charles, you surprise and grieve me.  Grace is my
daughter.  She may have self-respect and dignity, but
she will never lack in dutifulness.  Did you ever stop
to think, Charles, that you owe your place in life to
her?"
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't thinking of business, Mr. Rawn, and if
you please, we'll not discuss that.  I only spoke freely
because of what we both know&mdash;in fact, I'd rather stay
home than go to New York with you.  If you took
along your assistant&mdash;Miss Delaware, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
Rawn nodded.  "Yes, she has the details of the
sub-companies well in hand.  I want her along, just as I
want you, so that all questions can be answered as to
details of the office and factory work, in case I should
not personally be familiar with them&mdash;as I think I am,
for the most part."
</p>

<p>
"Then you couldn't use the stenographer on the
train&mdash;I mean the regular one?"
</p>

<p>
"I could not, Mr. Halsey," said John Rawn icily.
"What business is it of <i>yours</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"None in the least.  I was only thinking about any
possible talk.  She's a very beautiful girl, and
very&mdash;stunning.  Yes, on the whole, Mr. Rawn, I think it
better for me to go.  One day in New York ought to
do us, ought it not?"
</p>

<p>
Rawn nodded.  "Yes, we'll be back here on the
fourth day, at worst.  I've got to have you down there
to explain the different installations.  I am as
impatient as anybody else.  I want to get to the place where
I'll be making some real money."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had been," grinned Halsey.  "Your
house, for instance?"
</p>

<p>
"Over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in there
now, and as much more to go in later," said Rawn.
"I've spent over a half million altogether, private,
overheads and investments, since I went in with this
company.  My salary is only a hundred thousand, and
no man ever lives on his salary and lays up any money&mdash;he's
got to make his start on the side.  I've not done
badly in that way.  I'm learning the market from the
inside.  I've had one killing after another&mdash;Oil,
Rubber&mdash;awfully good luck.  Charles, the next ten years in all
likelihood will see me a rich man, very rich.  I've not
done badly now, for the son of a Methodist preacher
out of a little Texas town.  Let me tell you something.
Money is easy to make when you get the start.  It
rolls, I tell you, it rolls up like a snowball.  It grows
and spreads&mdash;there's nothing like it in its power.  It's
power itself!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
Rawn rose, soon pausing in his excited walk, in
his wonted posture, feet apart, hands under his coat
tails.  Halsey looked at him, frowning half sullenly, as
he went on.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Charles, there's nothing like money as an
ambition for a man!  When I hear you talking your folly,
about this brotherhood of man&mdash;when I see you worrying
your small head about the future of this republic,
you make me smile!  What difference about the
rest of the world if you take care of <i>yourself</i>?  There's
one brotherhood that's worth while, and only one, and
it isn't that of laboring men, of common men&mdash;it is
the brotherhood of big men who have made big money.
There's a union for you, son!  It does not break, it does
not snitch, it does not strike.  It sticks, it hangs
together&mdash;the union of big business men is the only one
worth while.  Come with me, and I'll show you some
proof of that."
</p>

<p>
Halsey looked at him, his eyes glittering, words of
scorn rising to his tongue; but he controlled himself.
"All right, Mr. Rawn," said he, "I'll be ready to start
to-morrow, and I'll count on getting back here by the
last of the week, at least.  Good day, sir."
</p>

<p>
He left the room quietly.  He was a handsome, stalwart
young man, but in some way his face did not look
happy.  Rawn sat staring at the door through which
he had disappeared.  There came over his feelings
some sort of vague dissatisfaction or apprehension,
he knew not what.
</p>

<p>
"I'm scared at something, just like those laborers,"
said he; "and when there's no reason in the world, so
far as any one can tell.  Pshaw!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
He flung himself around to his place at his desk, and
in doing so struck his hand against the pointed
letter-opener which lay there.  A tiny trickle of blood
appeared, which he sought to staunch with his
handkerchief.  At last he raised his head with a grin, and
remarked half aloud, to himself, "When in doubt,
touch the right-hand button!"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Delaware," said he an instant later, as his
assistant appeared, "I've cut my hand a little.  I wish
you'd tell one of the boys to bring me a basin of hot
water, or some sticking plaster or something."
</p>

<p>
"If you will allow me, Mr. Rawn," she answered
respectfully, "I think I could fix that without trouble.
I have a little liquid ether and collodion in my desk.
It usually will stop any small cut, and it keeps it
clean.
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Rawn, "anything to stop the
bleeding&mdash;I must get to work."
</p>

<p>
She reappeared a moment later with a small bottle
and a pencil brush, and bending over, proceeded to
touch the tiny wound with the biting liquid, with
slight "Tch!" as she saw the hand wince under the
temporary sting.  Rawn looked at her with a singular
expression.
</p>

<p>
"It's odd, Miss Delaware," said he, "that I was just
saying to myself a minute ago that I'd bet a thousand
dollars that you had something ready, at just the right
time!  Thank you very much."
</p>

<p>
"By the way," he added, "I was just telling my
son-in-law Mr. Halsey, the superintendent of our works,
that it's going to be necessary for all three of
us&mdash;that is to say, myself, Mr. Halsey and you&mdash;to start
for New York to-morrow afternoon.  I'll probably
have to do some letters on the train, and you would
better see that a typewriter is sent on&mdash;Mr. Halsey
will give us the berth numbers in the morning, I
suppose.  Sorry to take you out of your work, but
then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I should like to go, above all things, Mr. Rawn,"
replied the young woman, still respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Of course, you go on company account.
Maybe you'll like the change of work and scene.
Please bring along all the reports on those Lower
Valley instalments, and all the estimates we've been
working on here for the last few days.  It might be
a good plan to have your files for the last month go
along, with your card indexes.  We've got to show
those people down there a thing or two.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you know our superintendent, Mr. Halsey&mdash;my
son-in-law," he added.  "He's going, too."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  He's here often.  Sometimes I've done
work for him, you know.  He does a good, clear
letter&mdash;but rather long.  He can't get through so much in
an hour as you can, Mr. Rawn."
</p>

<p>
When she had retired, Rawn was seized with an
impulsive desire to raise his secretary's salary again;
but he reflected that it would hardly do&mdash;although he
was convinced that he had the most efficient assistant
on the Street.  He did not know she was thinking of
Halsey at that moment.
</p>

<p>
Singularly enough, Charles Halsey was thinking of
Miss Delaware at about that same time.  He was saying
to himself, as he passed into the hall after nodding
to her: "By George, isn't she efficient!"  Practically
all the male clerks would have agreed with him had
they heard him.  With equal strenuousness, all the
female clerks would have dissented.  After he had said
to himself that Miss Delaware was efficient, Halsey
checked himself on the point of adding that she was
also something besides efficient.  He stopped the
thought so sharply that it stopped his stride as well.
There came to his mind the picture of his wife, now
soon to enter into woman's valley of the shadows.  He
paused, obliging his soul to render to his wife all
honor, all homage, all loyalty, all duty&mdash;indeed, all
those things which a wife will trade <i>en masse</i> for just
a little real spontaneous love.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
THEIR MASTER'S VOICE
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
"That may all be very well," commented one of
the members at the directors' meeting of the
International Power Company, held on the day of
Rawn's arrival in New York; "that may all be true,
but what do we know about the practical application?
I've heard of extracting gold from sea water&mdash;and the
fellow proved it right before your eyes!  The world
is full of these things, getting rich all at once, but
usually when we get to the bottom of it, there's the
same old gold brick."
</p>

<p>
The speaker was rather a slight man, with dark
pointed beard, a man whose name swayed railway
fortunes, but whose digestion was not worth mentioning.
Silence greeted his comment.  A dozen pairs of eyes
turned toward John Rawn from different points about
the long directors' table.  The speaker went on:
</p>

<p>
"I am ready to back anything I believe in, of course,
and I must say I believed in this&mdash;maybe because I
wanted to, it looked so good.  It's the pinkest,
prettiest, sweetest scheme I ever saw, and that's the fact.
But we don't <i>get</i> anywhere with it.  We've been
pouring money into these Chicago works, and there's
nothing doing.  We've been paying you a pretty stiff
salary, Mr. Rawn, and our total expenses have footed
up enormously.  We've got the work on the dam and
on the central transmission plant to show, yes, but
that's all.  And that wasn't why I went into this thing.
For one, I want to be shown a few things about the
Chicago installations.  It's that wireless receiver that's
got us all into this, and I want to know about that."
</p>

<p>
John Rawn made characteristic answer: "How much
is your stock worth, in your opinion, Van?" he
demanded quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I'll just about call that bluff right here," broke out
the dyspeptic financier.  "I'll take sixty for all my
holdings."
</p>

<p>
"How many shares?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm only in for three thousand."
</p>

<p>
"Push me that pen, Charles," commented John
Rawn casually.  "I'll make a memorandum of that,"
said he.  "It's a sale.  Will you please initial it?  You
shall have my check in due course."
</p>

<p>
The dyspeptic director hesitated for an instant.
"Put up or shut up!" exclaimed John Rawn roughly.
"I'm going to buy you out, and throw you out, right
here.  We don't want any cold-foot sitting here with
us.  This has got to be a bunch of fighting men, and
we don't want any quitters."
</p>

<p>
"I'll not stand for that!" began the dyspeptic.  "I
want to say&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You'll say nothing, and you'll stand for that,"
retorted Rawn.  "I'll get you the cash here in copper
pennies if you like, inside of five minutes.  O.K. that
paper, and cancel your right to vote.  The meeting
isn't called to order yet, and the books are not
closed."
</p>

<p>
"That's the talk!" growled a deep voice farther toward
the end of the table.  The general traffic man of
earlier days, Ackerman, of St. Louis, was the speaker.
"I'll take half of that myself, Rawn."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and divide it with me, Ackerman," nodded
Standley, the railway president to whom Rawn had
first brought his device.
</p>

<p>
The dissatisfied director paled yet more.  "Oh,
well," said he, "if that's the way you feel about it,
I'll just call your bluff.  Here's my initials; and you're
welcome to my stock."
</p>

<p>
"Record it!" said Rawn tersely, throwing the memorandum
across to the treasurer.  "Have you got the
stock here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, right in my inside pocket," retorted the other
savagely.
</p>

<p>
"Pass it to the treasurer, then, if you please&mdash;that
is to say, if you will take the assurance of myself and
these gentlemen that we'll take up this memorandum."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course I'll do that," assented the other
grudgingly.
</p>

<p>
"Then that'll be about all," said Mr. Rawn.  "And
as this is to be a directors' meeting, why, maybe&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The dyspeptic financier was already reaching for his
hat and coat.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
"I want <i>all</i> you gentlemen to feel," said John Rawn
calmly, "that there's a chance to lay down right here,
if your feet are getting cold.  Better quit now than
later on.  I won't work with men who haven't got
heart in this thing.  If any of you are scared, let me
know.  I couldn't take over all your stock myself, of
course, but if you want to let go, I believe I can swing
another company organization."
</p>

<p>
They looked at him silently, here and there a gray
head shaking in negation.  Rawn's eye lighted.
</p>

<p>
"That's the idea!" said he; "we'll all sit tight."
</p>

<p>
He turned to catch the eye of the late director, who
was now passing toward the door.  "I'm going," said
the latter importantly.
</p>

<p>
"And good riddance!" said John Rawn calmly.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take care of you for that, one of these days,
Mr. Rawn!"
</p>

<p>
"Why not now?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll see what I'll do to you in the market!"
</p>

<p>
"The market be damned!" said John Rawn evenly.
"There isn't any market.  There isn't anything to buy
or sell.  If there is any stock offered, I'm the market,
right here and now.  Go on and do what you can.
The more you talk of what you don't know about, the
more you'll boom this thing; so turn yourself loose,
if you feel like it.  I've got our superintendent here
to prove this thing out&mdash;to the <i>directors</i> of this
company, Mr. Van.  The meeting is informal, but it may
be instructive.  We can fill any vacancy on the board
at some other time, maybe."
</p>

<p>
A large, bearded man, with drooping lower eyelids,
who sat across the table, chuckled to himself gently as
the ex-director slammed the door.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then&mdash;" said a tentative voice.
</p>

<p>
All these men were men of large affairs.  They
would have spared no time for this meeting had it
not seemed to them much worth their while.
</p>

<p>
"Van's going to talk," said one voice.
</p>

<p>
"Let him talk about what he likes," rejoined Rawn.
"It's close communion for the rest of us.  Well, then,
have we all got cards?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
There was a grim look on each face along the table
which suited the fancy of the speaker.  "All right,
then," said he.  "There are only two or three of you
who ever saw our device actually at work.  I've got
my report all brought up to date.  Mr. Halsey will
tell you what he has been doing in the works, how he
has been handicapped, why we can not turn over at
once a completed installation of one of our motors.  We
know perfectly well that a great deal of money has
been expended.  We don't want you to put in that
money unless you are satisfied of returns, big returns.
Gentlemen, are you ready to see the gold brick?
Would you like to look at the little joker, or see if you
can find the pea under the shell?  If so, there will be
further opportunity for those who want to drop out.
But I'd very much prefer you'd drop out now and not
after our experiments."
</p>

<p>
There was no answer, beyond a growl from Ackerman,
a twitched hand of the bearded man.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Halsey rose and placed on the table the little model
which he took from the case at his side.  In principle,
it was the same which had been shown in the original
demonstration at St. Louis, long before, although in
workmanship it was in this instance a trifle more
finished, showing more of shining brass and steel.
Halsey looked about hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we use the fan again?" he inquired of
Mr. Rawn.
</p>

<p>
"Not on your life!" cried out Ackerman.  "No more
fan bursting goes.  You'll put on the little railway,
here on the table, as you were showing me the other
day."
</p>

<p>
"You gentlemen all know the general theory of the
invention," Halsey went on, again assuming the post of
lecturer, which Rawn once more graciously surrendered
to him, waving a hand largely in his direction as
though in explanation to the others.  "It's simply the
attuning of a motor to the free electrical current in the
air&mdash;the wireless idea, of course.  You're posted on all
this.  Now, I've got some little things here which will
show some of the applications of our idea.  We'll make
a little track, for a railway train, and we'll run its
motor here with current of our own, simply by our
receiver for the free current.
</p>

<p>
"I've often thought of the applicability of our
receivers to the use of automobiles.  Any man could
have one of these receivers in his own garage, and
could charge his own machine as he liked.  That's only
one use of the idea.  What is true regarding auto cars
is true also of plows, wagons, nearly all farm
machinery.  One of these receivers which you could carry
around under your arm would do the work of many
men, of many horses.  With this model here I can, as
Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Standley will agree, burst
that electric fan wide open, and with no wire attachment
for any current whatever.  And I think we can
run this little train of cars."
</p>

<p>
A sigh went around the table at these calm words.
These grave, gray men looked intently, bending
forward at the edge of the table as young Halsey
completed his mechanical arrangements.
</p>

<p>
"If this thing works," said the large, bearded man,
leaning forward, "where does it leave railway
transportation?"
</p>

<p>
"It leaves it with us!" interrupted John Rawn.
"With us absolutely!"
</p>

<p>
"What's to hinder anybody from building all the
railroads they want, and making all the cars they want,
and taking all the power they want out of the air, as
you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing in the world to prevent," said John Rawn,
"except the solidarity of the railway men of this
country.  If we take you all in and if you all stand
pat, what chance has any one else got, except through
buying power of us?  Of course, this thing would
break us if used against us.  But we don't propose to
see it used that way.  Our patents protect us."
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said the bearded man.  "Let's see the
wheels go 'round."
</p>

<p>
They saw as much, and more.  Halsey's little car
repeated its circuit about the long table again and
again, tirelessly, operated by power taken from the
unwired receiver.  Where the receiver got its power
Halsey explained in detail as he had done before.
</p>

<p>
The thing was there to show for itself.  As to the
breadth of its application, these men needed no advice.
They were accustomed to the look ahead, to the
weighing of wide possibilities.
</p>

<p>
"It's like the French conjurer, gentlemen," said
John Rawn smiling.  "He operates with his sleeves
rolled up.  'There is no <i>d√©ception</i>, by friends,' says
he.  There's the whole works on the table right
before us.  If it isn't a tremendous thing I'm the worst
fooled man in all this world, and I'll be the worst
broke man in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Toot!  Toot!" remarked a jovial voice from
Standley's end of the table.  "Start her up again,
son&mdash;I never get tired of seeing that thing go like the
Chinaman's cable car."  Levity was a relief to them.
There is a certain strain, after all, in planning for the
ownership of a people, a republic.
</p>

<p>
Halsey again pushed down the lever, and again the
dummy car ran around and about the table on the
curved track which had been laid for it.
</p>

<p>
"That's the travel of the future, gentlemen," said
John, Rawn soberly, at length.  "They can take it or
leave it.  So can you."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Silence fell on that group of gray, grave men.  The
thing seemed to them uncanny, although so simple.
They looked about, one at the other.  A sort of sigh
passed about the room.  There sat at the table men
who represented untold millions of capital.  They were
looking upon a device which in the belief of all was
about to multiply these millions many-fold.  Their
hands already inordinately full of power, they contemplated
yet more inordinate power.  They sat fascinated,
silent, sighing at the prospect, in a delicious
half-delirium.  The forehead or the upper lip of each was
moist.
</p>

<p>
"You can't get away from it, fellows," said Standley,
of St. Louis.  "I've tried to, my best, and I can't.
I felt just the way you do when it was first put up to
me&mdash;I didn't want to face the truth, it was so big.  As
soon as these two men went away from me my feet
got cold; but if they hadn't come back, I think I'd
have jumped in the river.  I <i>want</i> to let go of this
thing right here&mdash;it scares me.  But I just can't, that's
all."
</p>

<p>
They made no comment.  The atmosphere seemed
strangely strained, tense.  An old and beardless man,
thin, pallid, leaned against the table, his eyes staring,
his face almost corpse-like.  No voice was raised in
criticism or indeed in comment, but all sat weighing,
pondering.  Rawn was the first to break the silence.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said he, "of course this is the big
part of our company patents, and it is over this that
we've met to-day.  You've been doubting my executive
ability.  I have shown you what the prize is that
we're working for&mdash;-there it is on the table.  As to the
difficulties of pulling off a thing as big as this, they are
bigger in this case than could be expected or figured
out in advance.  Our superintendent, Mr. Halsey here,
tells me that he is having a great deal of trouble in
labor matters.  The men are discontented, and what
is worse, they're <i>curious</i>, all the time.  We can't
employ just any sort of irresponsible labor, and we can't
complete one machine&mdash;we've got to bring them <i>all</i>
through, at once, together&mdash;indeed, got pretty near to
finish them all ourselves.  We can't take any people in
on this secret, of course.  It all takes time, and it all
takes money.
</p>

<p>
"I've got my report here, all these pages, which I'll
not trouble you to read unless you like.  What I want
to say is this: we've got our power plant, and our wire
transmitter system, and we're making money on that,
as everybody knows.  We can pay dividends on the
old way of transmitting power, developing the 'juice'
by water power and peddling it out by wire.  We can
pay ten per cent., and a stock dividend every year, for
we are earning nineteen and eight-tenths per cent. now,
on wire work alone, not mentioning our exclusive
franchises.  Nobody can put a value on those.  Up
to this time most of us have been contented to reach
out and get hold of water powers in the old way&mdash;that
didn't look so slow to us then as it does now.  If
we should throw away, entirely, this part of our
device, we still would stand just as safe as we ever
would have stood.
</p>

<p>
"Again, suppose we wanted to play the market, and
throw away every idea of using this second current of
electricity.  We could list this stock to-morrow and
make it the most active issue on the Street.  That's
plain to all of us.
</p>

<p>
"Again, let's reason over this matter and see
whether it isn't impatience and not distrust which is
troubling all of us.  We haven't really spent so very
much money in the receiver installations.  There isn't
a stockyards firm in Chicago which doesn't put aside a
bigger appropriation every year for scientific
experimenting than we're putting into what is no experiment,
but a certainty.  It is a drop in the bucket, as my
figures here show distinctly.
</p>

<p>
"Now, since these things are true, I just came down
here to ask you gentlemen what it is that you want?
You've been criticizing me.  We've thought enough of
this thing to plan legislation in Congress and in the
adjoining states where we are working.  We've been at
a lot of trouble one way or other.  We've wanted to get a
grip on this country which couldn't be shaken off by
any political or industrial changes.  That's just what
I'm offering you here, gentlemen.  Pretty much the
whole business world will be yours.  <i>I</i> brought you
this, didn't I?  Now, do you want a nice gold fence
around the world with diamond tips to the pickets;
or what is it that you do want?  Up to this time you've
wanted what was impossible.  Now I've shown you
that the impossible <i>is</i> possible.  Here it is, on the
table in front of you&mdash;here's the proof.  Unless I am
drunk or crazy, the future governors of the United
States of America are sitting right here at this table."
</p>

<p>
He touched the glass top lightly, gently, with his
finger-tips, which had no tremor in them.  John Rawn was
completely master of himself.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
"But it <i>has</i> cost a lot of money, Rawn," began one
director hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"That's a relative term," answered Rawn.  "I have
all the details here among my figures.  It is much or
little, as you care to look at it&mdash;it doesn't seem much to
me.  We've run this thing down to rock-bed economy
all the time.  We cut our men a dollar a week last
month, and it started a riot.  We're trying to save all
the money we can, of course&mdash;it's my money that is
being spent just the same as yours, my time that is
wasting, just the same as yours.  I'm as eager as you
to get my hands on this thing, and to get its hands
on this country.  But there's such a thing as losing
by lack of confidence, and many and many a good
thing has been lost by lack of money backed by nerve.
What do you want, gentlemen?  I can't do much more
than I have done."
</p>

<p>
"And it's enough!" cried the bearded man, his
voice harsh, strident with his emotion.  "We've got
to have it!  Let's stick, let's stick, fellows!  They'll
never shake us off.  There is absolutely no limit to
this thing."
</p>

<p>
"Is that still the way you feel, Jim?" asked Standley
from his end of the table.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is; how about it, gentlemen?" answered
Ackerman's deep voice.
</p>

<p>
His eyes turned from one to the other, and found
no dissent, although the air of each man was earnest,
almost somber.
</p>

<p>
"Shake hands, then!" called out the bearded man
with enthusiasm, a man who had swayed millions by
the force of his own convictions before that time.
</p>

<p>
"Let's all shake hands, then, gentlemen," said John
Rawn.
</p>

<p>
They did so, each man reaching out his hands to
his neighbor; Halsey, of course, stepping back as not
belonging to that charmed circle.  They made a ring
around that table of countless, untold millions, of
uncounted, unmeasured power.  Their faces would
have made study sufficient for the greatest painter of
the world.  There was not a young man present, not
one whose face did not show lines deep graven, whose
hair was not white, or gray, or grizzled.  Many faces
there were, but from the eyes of each shone the same
light.  The grasp of the hand of each meant the same
thing.  They stood, hand clasped to hand, soul clasped
to soul; greed and power clasped to greed and power.
</p>

<p>
"Move we 'journ," said Ackerman.  The president
dropped the gavel on the table top.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
Rawn finally escaping from the crowd of importunate
reporters who waited in the halls, at length
broke away to go to his rooms.  He met Halsey in
the lobby.  The latter had in his hand a telegram,
which shook somewhat as he extended it.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Rawn, turning toward him with a
frown, "what is it?"
</p>

<p>
He read: "Charles S. Halsey, The Palatial, New
York: Your child is a girl.  The mother is doing well.
You would best return at once.  There is a slight
deformity.  You must share this grief with the mother
when she knows&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Rawn dropped the message to the floor.  Halsey's
face looked so desperately old and sad that for one
moment Rawn almost forgot his own grief.  "You'd
better go on home, Charley," he said.  "Too bad&mdash;to
get such news now!  But isn't that just like a woman!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
IN PROPER PERSON
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
John Rawn stood looking at the unceasing
throng which surged confusedly through the corridors
of the gilded hotel.  Warmth, music, a Babel of
voices, were all about.  There approached a little
group of laughing men coming from the carriage
entrance, bound, no doubt, to a banquet hall somewhere
under the capacious roof.  One voice rose above the
the others as the group advanced.  There appeared,
rapidly talking and gesticulating as he came, a
ruddy-faced, stocky figure, with head close-cropped, jaw
undershot, small eyes, fighting terrier make-up.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, gentlemen, I'll compromise not in the
least on this matter!  It makes no difference what they
do with the ticket or with me.  There's only one way
about these matters, and that's the right way!  I care
nothing whether this man be a rich man or a poor
man.  The only question is, whether he is <i>right</i>.  If
he is not right, he will never&mdash;I say to you, gentlemen&mdash;"
this with close-shut jaw and fist hard smitten
into palm&mdash;"I say to you, it makes no difference who
he is or what he is, he'll never win through; and in the
event you suffer from us&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He passed on, gesticulating, talking.  Men
commented audibly, for there was no mistaking a man
idealized by some, dreaded by others, scorned by
none, anathematized by not a few.  He was to address
that night a meeting of independent politicians,
so-called, here in the very house of individualistic power,
and many old-line members of his party had their
doubts, the fear of a new party being ever present in
the politician's mind&mdash;the same fear professional
politicians, Whig, Democrat, what-not, had of the new
party formed before the Civil War at the command of
a people then claiming self-government as their ancient
right&mdash;as now they begin again to do, facing our third
War of Independence.
</p>

<p>
"Going strong, isn't he?" commented one sardonically,
within Rawn's hearing.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, my friend," was the smiling
answer of yet another.  "Strong enough to make a lot of
you hunt your holes yet.  There's quite a few people in
this little old country outside this island&mdash;and he'll&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  No chance, not the least chance in the
world!"
</p>

<p>
"You underestimate this new movement," began the
other.
</p>

<p>
"New movement!&mdash;you're 'progressive,' eh?  Got
that bee?  A lot of good it'll do you.  It will be simply
a new line-up following our old and time-tried political
methods&mdash;it all comes to that, take my word.  The
people aren't in politics.  A lot of professionals do
our governing for us."
</p>

<p>
"All the same, there goes the people's candidate!"
</p>

<p>
"Take him and welcome," was the answer.  "Take
your candidate.  We'll eat him up&mdash;if he runs."
</p>

<p>
They also passed on down the hall, gesticulating,
their voices swallowed up with others, arising
confusedly.  This and that couple or group passed by,
also talking, among them many persons obviously of
notoriety, importance or distinction, though unknown
to their observer.  Rawn stood and watched them all.
The scene was to his liking.  The stir, the confusion,
appealed to him.  The flowering of the great city's
night life was here, such as that is.  It was the focus
of our country's civilization, such as that is.  Men
worth millions passed, shoulder to shoulder, a
wondrous procession, such as that is.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
And here and there, always moving and mingling
with those men whose reception or whose raiment
announced them as persons of importance, moved women,
beautiful women, floating by, brightly, radiantly,
rustlingly&mdash;women blazing with jewels, women with
bright eyes, women whose apparel bespoke them as
accepted integers of the city's vast human sum.
</p>

<p>
Rawn stood studying the procession for a long time,
eying group after group carefully.  A conclusion was
forming in his mind.  He was learning that when a
man has achieved power, success, wealth, notoriety
even, he turns with his next thought to some woman;
and finds some woman waiting.
</p>

<p>
Not, as he reflected, a woman grown old and gray.
Not a woman with finger-tips blackened and roughened,
of bowed figure and ill-fitting garb, of awkward
and unaccustomed air&mdash;not to that sort of woman who
would be noticed here for her lack of fitness in this
place.  No, rather, as he noticed, men of influence or
position or power turned to such women as these
about him now&mdash;of distinct personality, of birth and
breeding, or at least of beauty; women shimmering
in silks, blazing in gems, women who looked up
laughing as they passed, women young and beautiful, whose
voices were soft, around whom floated as they walked
some subtle fascination.
</p>

<p>
Rawn pondered.  He saw passing a few men whom
he knew, all with women whom he did not know.  In
each case his new-formed rule seemed to hold good;
the exception being noted only in the bored and weary
faces of men accompanied by women perhaps rustling
and blazing in silks and diamonds, but not owning
youth and fascination.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn found that power and beauty go hand in
hand; that money and beauty also go hand in hand&mdash;which
is to say the same thing.  He began to ponder
upon youth, beauty and love as appurtenances of
wealth, success and power.
</p>

<p>
"That's the game!" he said half to himself.  "Why,
look at those chaps.  They look pretty much alike, act
pretty much alike, too.  When a man has money to
burn, there is only one way&mdash;and there it is!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
And then it occurred to John Rawn with sudden and
unpleasing force that, although he was among this
throng, he was not of it.  Himself a man of power,
success, yes, even of wealth, he lacked in certain
betokening appurtenances thereto.  A not unusual wave
of self-pity crept slowly over him.  Why should he,
a man of his attainments, lack in any degree what
others had?
</p>

<p>
He stood pondering, not wholly happy, until presently
he felt, rather than saw, a glance bent upon him
by a man who passed, a stately and well-garbed young
woman upon his arm.  He was a man now in faultless
evening dress, yet easily to be recognized&mdash;none
less, indeed, than the dyspeptic director who so
summarily had been dismissed by John Rawn himself not
three hours ago.  His dark face became even darker
as he saw the victor of that controversy standing here
alone.  He smiled sardonically.  To Rawn it seemed
that he smiled because he saw the solitary attitude of
a man as good as himself, as fit as himself for all the
insignia of power, yet publicly self-confessed as
lacking all such insignia.  He started, flushed, frowned.
He had shown these men, these influential magnates
in New York, that he could be their master upon
occasion&mdash;he had mastered this man passing yonder.  Yet
now he stood here alone, with no woman to advertise
his power to the world; and men laughed at him!  No
woman wore his silks, displayed his jewels.  He was
John Rawn, born to the purple; yet he might be taken
here for a country merchant on his first trip from
home....
</p>

<p>
He turned to the key-counter.  The clerk, with
infallible instinct&mdash;without his request&mdash;handed him the
key to his room, not lacking acquaintance with men of
Mr. Rawn's acquaintance, and knowing money when
he saw it....  Rawn passed down the hall, went up
two flights in the elevator, turned into the left-hand
corridor, and at length knocked deliberately at a door
where a light showed.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"Come!" called a soft voice.  He knocked again,
a trifle hesitant, and looked down the corridor, each
way.  The voice repeated, "Come!"  He pushed open
the door.
</p>

<p>
Virginia Delaware stood before her dressing-glass,
her toilet for evening completed except perhaps for a
touch or two about her coiffure.  She turned now, and
flushed as she saw her visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn!" she exclaimed; "I thought it was the
maid!  I had just called her."
</p>

<p>
Rawn turned and shut the door.  "Never mind her,"
he said.  "I will be gone in a minute.  I just wanted&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You must go!" she exclaimed.  "You ought not
to have come&mdash;it is not permitted&mdash;it is not right!"
</p>

<p>
"How stunning you look, Miss Delaware!" was all
he said.  He had never before seen her arrayed in
keeping with these other lilies of the field.  Indeed,
his life had given him small acquaintance with
conventions, or those who practised them.  He had no
mental process of analysis as he gazed at her now, or
he might have seen that after all the young woman's
costume was no more than one of filmy blue, draped
over a pure and lustrous white.  He could not have
named the fashion which drew it so daringly close
at hip and hem as to reveal frankly all the lines of a
figure which needed not to dread revelation for its
own sake, whether or not for other sake.  He could
not have guessed what skill belonged to the hand that
fashioned this raiment, could not have told its cost.
To him the young woman was very beautiful; and he
was too much confused to be capable of analysis.
The corsage of the gown, cut square and daringly
deep, displayed neck and shoulders white as those of
any woman of any city.  Her figure gave lines had her
costume not aided.  She was beautiful, yes.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
And there was something more, Rawn could not tell
what.  There was some air of excitement, of exaltation,
some sort of fever about her, upon her.  In her
eyes shone something Rawn had never noticed there
before.  Hastily he made such inventory as he might
of unanalyzed charms.  He arrived at his conclusion,
which was, that Virginia Delaware would do!
</p>

<p>
"You could travel in fast company, my dear girl,"
said he approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"  She turned upon him.
</p>

<p>
"That you could go quite a considerable pace, my
dear girl.  You'll <i>do</i>.  Let me see your hands!" he
demanded.  And in spite of her he coolly took up a
hand, examining the shapely finger-tips.  He sighed.
No needle had blackened or roughened them, the
typewriter keys had not yet flattened them.  He
stepped back, looked at her from head to foot, appraising
all her graces, valuing her height and roundness
of figure.  There was small light in his eye other than
that of judicial approval.  She bore out his theory.
</p>

<p>
"You surprise me!" was all he said.
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean, Mr. Rawn?&mdash;But you must go,
you really must!"
</p>

<p>
There came a knock at the door.  Rawn's negative
gesture was positive.  After a moment's hesitation the
girl stepped to the door and spoke to the maid.  "You
may return again in a little while, maid," she said.
"I'm not quite ready now."  In turn she stood with
her back against the door, her own color rising.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't be uneasy," said John Rawn smiling.
"This is quite considerable of a hotel, taking it as it is.
There won't be any scandal over this."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I understand you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going in just five minutes.  But I want to say
something to you in the way of a business proposition,
Miss Delaware."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't know what you mean."  Her head
was high, her color still rising.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing in the least wrong, my dear girl," said
John Rawn.  "It's simply a matter of business, as I said.
You're here as my assistant, of course.  But did it
ever occur to you that as you stand there now, and
as I stand here, we might pass in that crowd below
there and not be known by <i>any one</i>?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
She still stood looking at him, her color high,
undecided as to his meaning even now as he went on.
</p>

<p>
"It would be rather a pleasant experience, perhaps,
for you&mdash;as it would be for me&mdash;just to mingle with
that giddy throng&mdash;say, for dinner.  Would you like to
be part of it?  It's just a foolish thought that came to
me."
</p>

<p>
She turned to him, her eyes bright, her face eager.
"Could we, Mr. Rawn?" she said.  "I'm crazy over it!"
</p>

<p>
"I see," he commented dryly.  "You were dressing
to go down to dinner?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, I couldn't afford to do that, of course.  I
couldn't go alone, and I had no company.  I wasn't
going down at all.  I just dressed up&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Just to look at yourself in the mirror, isn't that it,
Miss Delaware?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's the truth!"  She turned to him calmly at
last, well in hand again.  "I couldn't be one of
them&mdash;couldn't be like those people down below, so I did the
best I could up here&mdash;I dressed as much like them as
I knew how.  I&mdash;I&mdash;I <i>imagined</i>!  I dreamed, Mr. Rawn.
I've never known a real evening of that sort
in all my life&mdash;but it's in my blood.  I want to go, I
want to dine, and drink, and dance&mdash;I'm mad about
it, I know, but it's the truth!  I want what I can't
have.  I want to be what I'm not.  I don't know what's
the reason.  It's in the air&mdash;maybe it's in the day,
in the country!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's the country," said John Rawn.  "We're
all going a swift pace, men and women both.  I don't
blame you.  I understand you.  Now I know what you
want."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"You want just about what <i>I</i> want."
</p>

<p>
"But, Mr. Rawn&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's the same thing&mdash;it's <i>power</i> that you want, just
as I do.  I feel it in the air when I come near you.
You feel the same way when you come near me!"
</p>

<p>
She nodded rapidly, her eyes narrowing.  "Yes, it's
true!" she said.  "That's true."
</p>

<p>
"You want to have it within your ability to influence
men, just as I do, don't you, Miss Delaware?  That's
what was in your soul when you stood before your
mirror there when I came in, wasn't it, Miss Delaware?
You want to win, to succeed, to triumph, don't
you, Miss Delaware&mdash;you've got <i>ambition</i>?  Wasn't
that your dream&mdash;isn't that what you were imagining,
as you stood there and looked in your glass?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, it's true, I know it!" she admitted panting.
"I know it, my God! yes, I can't help it!  But
what chance have I?"
</p>

<p>
"All sorts of chances, my dear girl.  I don't make
mistakes.  I told you this is a business proposition.
Now, then, tell me, why did you tog out this way?"
</p>

<p>
"I did it because I had to.  I told you I couldn't
help it.  It was in my blood to-night!"
</p>

<p>
"Any man waiting anywhere, Miss Delaware?"
</p>

<p>
"On my word, no!  I wasn't even going downstairs.
But I told you I was mad to be in that crowd,
where the rich people are.  I wanted to hear the music,
I wanted to see them&mdash;I wanted to pretend for one
night that I was a part of it all!"
</p>

<p>
"You wanted to win&mdash;you coveted power!  Is it
not true?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" she blazed fiercely.  And indeed at that
moment the room seemed full of some large influence,
moving, throbbing all about them.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
"I wanted that," the girl admitted.  "All the world
does!"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you wanted to see some strong man fall
on his knees and beg of you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, my dear, but I'll not do that.  But I
understand.  So you searched out these glad rags and
tried yourself out before the mirror there!  Very
good!  You'll do!  Believe me&mdash;or ask any man in all
this city."
</p>

<p>
She nodded rapidly.  "Yes, you know it, now."
</p>

<p>
"Now, you're no more mad than I am," said John
Rawn.  "You're as cool-headed as I am, if I know
women at all.  We think alike.  You're young.  I'm
young enough.  Where'd you get that gown?"
</p>

<p>
"I had it made&mdash;in an alley, in the city back home.
It cost as much as I could afford.  Thirty
dollars!"  She flung out the words scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"It looks three hundred; and I've seen worse below
to-night that probably cost three thousand.  But it's
not yet quite complete&mdash;your costume."
</p>

<p>
"It was the best I had.  You ought not to taunt me.
I stood here facing myself.  I felt disappointed, bitter!
Yes, I'll admit that."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be," said Rawn calmly.  He nodded to
her bare and unadorned neck, her hair which lacked
brilliants, her fingers left unjeweled.  The girl caught
his meaning without further speech, and it hurt her
yet more.
</p>

<p>
"What could I do?  Why did you bring me here,
Mr. Rawn?  You've made me unhappy.  I've seen it,
and I can't be a part of it.  It doesn't seem I can go
back there to work and be just the same any more,
after seeing the city here!  I tell you, it's got in my
blood, all at once."
</p>

<p>
"No," he said evenly, "not again just the same.  We
outgrow ourselves, and can't go back.  I'm not the
same man I once was."  He half-unconsciously shifted
to get a glimpse of himself in the mirror.
</p>

<p>
"But now, my business proposition is very simple.
It holds good for one evening, Miss Delaware.  I was
just going to propose that we forget all this unhappiness,
and do a little pretending for one night, say for
one hour or so."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, and drew out
something which suddenly flamed into dancing points
and rays in the light that fell upon it.  She stood
motionless while he passed about her neck a tiny thread,
delicate as if spun of moonlight.  She held out her
hand, and he slipped over it a gleaming ring of gems.
She bent her head, and he placed a sparkling ornament
in her hair.  She had seen these jewels before.  She
turned to the glass now, her bosom heaving as she saw
them gleam at her own neck, her own hands, in her
own hair.  She held out her hands to look at them
now, and the gems flashed back challenge to her eyes,
sparkling yet more brilliantly.
</p>

<p>
"It was nothing," said John Rawn tersely.  "That's
all that lacked.  You're good as the best now.  I've
seen no woman in this city that is your equal in beauty.
You were born for this life.  Now do you understand
what I mean?  I say, you can carry it off!"
</p>

<p>
She turned to him, another woman, changing on
the instant, something in her eyes he had never seen
before.  But in his own eyes there was at the time
nothing save the original calm and purposefulness.
</p>

<p>
"As I was saying, then, since we can both carry it
off, why not do so for an hour or so?  I've read
somewhere of masquerades.  Why not try it?"
</p>

<p>
She turned to him, flushed, radiant, but slightly
frowning, puzzled, studying him.  Rawn felt the query
of her look, felt also something stirring down in his
nature which he grappled at once and was able to
suppress.  His voice was cool and low as it was
before.
</p>

<p>
"It's a big crowd below, and we'll be lost in it.  I've
learned already that you can be discreet.  We'll drop
down in there, where no one knows us.  We'll try ourselves
out, and see whether we'll do, here where the test
is hardest.  You're ambitious?  So am I.  This is the
heart of the world&mdash;the place of gratified ambitions.
What do you say, Miss Delaware?  I've been looking
around down there, and as nearly as I can see, I'm
the only man in this avenue worth a million dollars
who at this precise moment of the day isn't talking to
some good-looking woman!"
</p>

<p>
"You flatter me!" commented the girl.  He did not
endeavor any analysis.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least!  I simply talk sense and business
to you.  I covet what you covet, love what you love,
want what you want.  Things which are equal to the
same thing ought to be equal to each other&mdash;for just
a little while, Miss Delaware.  Isn't it true?  If it is
only play, why, let's play at it.
</p>

<p>
"I forgot to tell you," he added, "that my son-in-law,
Mr. Halsey, has gone back to Chicago.  He was
summoned by wire.  No one else knows us both.
There wouldn't be one chance in many of our being
seen by any one here who knew either of us, and
if so, what harm?  We'll go and dine as well as the
best of them, in the main room.  What do you say,
Miss Delaware?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
She stood facing him now, seeming years older than
she had a few moments before.  A very skilled
observer might possibly have suspected a certain new
quality in the calmness of her eye.  Beautiful she
certainly was; alluring, irresistible in the ancient appeal
of woman, she certainly ought to have been, and
would have been to any but this particular man who
now stood facing her, half smiling; a man of middle
age, gray about the temples, of heavy-browed eyes,
strongly lined face, of strong and bony frame; not an
ill-looking or unmanly man one might have said,
though years older than this young woman who stood
now threading between her fingers the filmy moonshine
chain which suspended the points of flame that
rose and fell upon her bosom.
</p>

<p>
At last she said, hesitating, and holding up the
flaming pendant, "I'm not to keep them?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Marguerite!" he smiled.  "This particular
Papa Faust retains a string on those jewels.  They
have been seen elsewhere, my dear girl.  No, one
night's use of them is all this business proposition
carries, my dear."
</p>

<p>
He began to be just a shade more familiar; but she
looked at him, still curiously helpless, because she
found him strong where most men are weak and
defenseless.  He caught some sort of challenge in her
attitude and in spite of himself trod a half step forward....
She evaded him.  He heard her laughter rippling
in the hall, and followed....  Soon they were
in the crowded lift, packed in against shirt front and
aigrette, silks and jewels, arms and bosoms bared for
the evening's fray.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
It may be true that no gentleman is grown in less
than three generations, but it is not the case that it
requires three generations to produce an aristocrat;
and here was simple and perfect proof of that
assertion.  Head waiters make no mistakes!  The
head-waiter of the main hall unhesitatingly took John Rawn
and his companion to as good a table as there was in
the room.  He knew the air of distinction when he
saw it!
</p>

<p>
Heads, in plenty, of men and other women, turned
as they passed through in that careless throng of the
world-wise and blas√©.  They walked by quietly, simply,
took their places with no ostentation.  John Rawn had
bethought him earlier as to the dinner order.  He gave
his directions now quietly, without hesitation.
</p>

<p>
The two ate and drank discreetly, comported themselves,
in fact, easily as any of these scores of others.
They did not lean toward each other and obviously
talk secrets, they did not laugh uneasily and stare
about.  Among the many well-bred women in that
room&mdash;where at least a few such were present&mdash;none
showed an easier accustomedness than Virginia
Delaware.  Her eagerness, her feverish anxiety, all now
were gone.  She was perfectly in hand.  It was her
pleasure now only to prove her fitness for such a scene,
to comport herself as though she had known no other
surroundings than these in all her life.  Once more
the miracle of possibility in the young American
woman was shown.
</p>

<p>
Rawn, discreet as his companion, looked on with
approval.  "You're <i>it</i>!" he once whispered across the
table, as he bent above the menu.  "You <i>are</i> the
part!"  Suddenly there came to him out of this occasion an
additional surge of self-confidence.  Yes, he said to
himself, he, too, could travel this gait.  He could step
easily into this life, the summit of life in America&mdash;as
he thought&mdash;as though born to it.  He could spend
money with the best.  He could obtain for himself as
beautiful a woman to wear his jewels as any man here
in all this great city.  He could as widely advertise
his power, his wealth, as any of these.  Did he not
see envious eyes bent upon his companion and upon
himself?  It was done!  He had won!  He had succeeded!
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
XII
</p>

<p>
After all, it had been easy, as he had found so many
things easy in the test.  As to the young woman with
him, John Rawn's cold heart went out in admiration.
"By Jove!" he said, "she's a <i>lady</i>, that's what she is.
She'd be&mdash;"  Yet it is to be noted that his admiration
for this young woman was primarily based not upon
the usual impulses of men so situated, but upon a
vast self-respect, for that <i>he</i> had placed her here and
so proved his own judgment to be good.  Some souls
are slow to any love but that of self, the approbation
of self being the breath of life to them.  Even the
beauty of Virginia Delaware&mdash;and she was beautiful&mdash;was
swallowed up in John Rawn's love and admiration
for himself.
</p>

<p>
There was, thus far, no suggestion of impropriety
between them, now or later.  They dined long,
deliberately and well.  Miss Delaware drank no wine,
Rawn himself only abstemiously.  The keenest delight
of the evening felt by either came not of food or
drink.  The intoxication of the city's night life fell
upon them, entered their souls.  Distant and
low-voiced musical instruments set the air athrob with
sensuous melody.  Flowers bloomed, jewels blazed, soft
voices rose, wine added its stimulus here and there.
Cut beyond this luxury, this sensuousness, beyond the
novelty of it, beyond the vague impulses of a common
humanity which runs through all the world, they felt
the last and subtle delight which comes with an
admitted assuredness of self&mdash;the consciousness of power
and ability to prevail, the certainty of knowing all the
path, all the full orbit of the great.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
XIII
</p>

<p>
As they sat thus calmly, apparently, as most might
have said, old habitu√©s of scenes like this, apparently
persons of wealth and distinction, Rawn felt once
more bent upon him the look of a passer-by.  There
approached the table where they sat the couple he had
seen earlier that evening, a stately and beautiful young
woman, whose features now were a trifle more
animated, whose eyes were brighter; and with her the
same dyspeptic director, sallow, with pointed dark
beard.  His face flushed still more as he saw John
Rawn and his companion.  He turned an admiring
gaze upon the latter, whom of course he did not
recognize.  Rawn caught the gaze.  It was the keenest
delight of his evening that he could smile back, showing
his own teeth also.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" muttered the ex-director to himself.
</p>

<p>
"I beg pardon!" haughtily commented his own fair
companion, who had caught his gaze aside.  "You
know that person?  Who is she?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, my dear&mdash;I'm just trying to think.
Her face&mdash;it looks like the goddess on some stock
certificate I've seen&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, goddess with a handful of lightning bolts."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  We might call her the 'Lady of the Lightnings'
to-night.  She surely does shine like the bright
and morning star, the way she's illuminated&mdash;eh,
what?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, hang it all!  Yes.  She's a looker, too!"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, <i>indeed</i>!  And they both look like ready
money."  The ex-director gave a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know them?" asked his companion,
more placated as they readied the corridor, where
Virginia Delaware was at last out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't know her&mdash;never saw her before,
unless, as I said, in an engraving.  Don't worry&mdash;I
haven't got any of the engravings&mdash;now."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Fellow by name of Rawn, from Chicago."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
JOHN RAWN, PROMINENT CITIZEN
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
The blare and blaze of American life went on in all
its capitals of industry.  Buildings sprang up,
factories poured their smoke unceasingly into the sky.
Men ran hither and thither like ants, busy about what
seemed to them of importance.  Vast hives of heaped-up
stone twice daily poured out their population of
small creatures, some of them crippled, hurt, shorn in
the battle of life, their faces pale, their forms bowed
and stunted before their time.  Out of the rich West
poured always a steady stream of the products of the
soil and of the mines, wealth unspeakable, dug from
the resources of this admirable country of ours.  Many
produced it, a few controlled it, all required it.
</p>

<p>
But there came a sort of hush over all the country,
as though an eclipse were passing, or some gloom cast
by a cloud coming between these cities and the sun.
Men said that business was not so good as it should be,
though the country was richer than ever.  None
understood the popular unrest.  Many pondered, many
attempted to explain, but they found all save the easy
and obvious explanation.  The masses remained
morose, dissatisfied.  Pamphlets appeared.  In the
journals pretending to give voice to popular trend of
thought there were now to be seen many screeds from
many unknown men.  Some men said that prices should
rise, others that rates of transportation should rise,
but that wages should decrease.  Others said that wages
should increase&mdash;a few only of these, not many; for
those who needed most a larger wage were those most
dumb of expression, least able and least apt to make
any public protest.  Our proudest may be our
poorest&mdash;our neediest our most silent.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
In John Rawn's slowly growing factories near the
western capital wages did not rise.  He kept on his
fight with the labor organizations.  For this reason
he met additional expense and additional delay in
carrying on his plans, but still waged war, relaxing not
at all, meeting pickets with policemen, force with
force.  The popular discontent of the day meant
nothing to him.  His eye was fixed ahead.  To Halsey's
complaints on the one side, his directors' discreet
grumbling on the other, he paid as little attention on
the one hand as upon the other.  John Rawn had a
dream, and he knew that his dream must come true.
His dream was one of a wide-reaching and relentless
power, shared by those few men destined by fate to
own the so-called American republic.  Let the people
do what they would, all they could.  This was his
dream.  It had come to him in all its fullness one
evening in the great city of the East.  He exulted.
</p>

<p>
As to the industrial situation in International Power,
Rawn now began to prove himself a good business
man, and he received more and more the grudged
confidence of his associates, who came from almost every
rank of big business.  Through the aid and advice of
these, his private fortune began to mount up
enormously.  So also did International Power make money.
The only sore place of the directors' overstrained
nerves centered in affairs at the gaunt building in the
suburb, where a dozen mysterious machines, toothed
and armed, cogged and coiled, still stood in a state of
half-completion, as inchoate and mysterious now as
they had been at their inception.  None of the
workmen, none of the foremen, could guess what they
would look like when completed.
</p>

<p>
There was something else, which not the most
suspicious guessed&mdash;<i>John Rawn himself did not know!</i>  His
success was a vast bubble.  Halsey was the only
man who ever had known the full secret of mantling
one of the miraculous receivers which they all had seen
and all had accepted.  Rawn, bold enough, kept this
to himself, although he feared to go to Halsey and
make any demands.  Halsey held grim peace for
months&mdash;indeed, for more than four years in all,
counting from the first motor made in the Kelly Row
woodshed.  It was risky, but for once Rawn dared make no
desperate move.  Halsey talked little.  He was very
sad since the birth of his hunchbacked child.
Sometimes he talked to Virginia Delaware about it; never to
his wife, Grace.
</p>

<p>
And still the seven days' wonder of International
Power remained to puzzle the industrial world.  No
inkling of the real intention of the company ever got
out.  There was, as Rawn had predicted, no market
for the stock, for the reason that it was not listed and
for the further reason that it was not sold.  It was
held in a close communion of hard-headed and close-mouthed
men, and there were no confidences betrayed.
The thing was too big to conform to ordinary rules.
In the center of all this stood the figure of John Rawn,
suddenly grown large and strong.  He ruled his army,
officers, staff and line, cavalry, infantry and auxiliaries,
as one born originally to command.  He brooked
neither parleying nor thwarting of his will&mdash;except in
one instance.  He never made any demands on Halsey,
never gave him any peremptory orders after that one
day in the office, months earlier, before Halsey made
his first trip to New York.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
These months seemed to have aged John Rawn,
none the less.  He grew grimmer and grayer, more
taciturn and reserved.  At the clubs he was one of the
most talked-of men in town, and one who talked least
himself.  As his hair grew grayer at the temples, his
jaw grew harder, at the corner of his chin coming the
triangular wrinkles which go with hard-faced middle
age.  Enigmatic, self-centered, he could not have been
called a happy man.  He smiled but rarely, joked not
at all, engaged in no badinage, told no stories, found
no lighter side of life, played no golf, had no
vacations.  Like some vast engine of tremendous driving
power he went on his way, admired in a city and
country full of able men, as one competent to hold his
own with the best and strongest of them all.  And still
of all his traits stood out the one of self-confidence.
He played a game of enormous and continuous
risk&mdash;fundamental risk by reason of Halsey, incidental by
reason of his widely ballooned market operations; yet
his nerve held.  Moreover, he was learning the price
of success&mdash;an absolute devotion to the means of
success.  When he learned that the child of his daughter
was not a son, but a girl, and that it was a hunchback
for life, a sad-faced, unsmiling child&mdash;he set his jaws
for a moment, but said few words of condolence,
either to his daughter or her husband.  He did not
smile for three months after that, and never referred
to this subject again, after its first discussion with his
wife at Graystone Hall; but it cost him no time and no
energy lost from business.  It only deepened in his
soul his growing hatred for Charley Halsey, the man
whom he dared not chide.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
In the headquarter offices a vast, smooth running
business machine had now been built up.  Rawn was
an organizer.  The laxness and looseness of the old
railway offices in St. Louis, where he had got his
business schooling, were missing in the headquarters of
International Power.  Employees had small time to
gossip in business hours.  Out of business hours, it is to
be confessed, once in a while there was discussion as
to the salary of Miss Virginia Delaware, which was
reported a wholly instable affair.  It was rumored in
stenographic circles that she had taken to wearing very
stunning evening gowns.  Yet not the most captious&mdash;though
willingness did not lack&mdash;could raise voice
against her, or couple her name with any other.  Rawn
and she were never seen together excepting during
business hours; he never mentioned her name in any
company.  Once or twice a laughing voice at the
National Union, where rich men met in numbers, tried to
create some sort of discussion over Rawn's beautiful
private secretary, but it was so suddenly stopped by
Rawn himself that it never was resumed.
</p>

<p>
Upon the other hand, few could speak in definite
knowledge regarding the domestic matters of John
Rawn.  He was a man of mystery, though one of
known and admitted power.  He held what he gained;
and, as there must have been accorded to him strength
of soul, grasp, readiness, courage, he began to be
accepted as one of the large figures of his day alike in
industry and finance.  He had by this time fully arrived
in the prominent citizen class in his chosen metropolis.
Did firemen perish, John Rawn joined the list
of those who aided the widows.  Was some neighboring
city swept by flames, again he joined&mdash;on the front
page of the papers&mdash;those who gave succor for the
needy.  Did a famine in India or China sweep off a
million souls, John Rawn&mdash;on the front page&mdash;aided the
survivors.  He was a member of the leading clubs of
the city, a director of the board of the art institute.  He
bought if he did not occupy a box at the opera, and
allowed his name to be mentioned at the banquets offered
by eager souls to celebrities of one sort or another who
proved themselves amenable to receptions, banquets,
addresses of welcome, and what-not, anything to bring
lesser names into print on any page, tails to any kite.
In short, John Rawn comported himself as a prominent
citizen should.  Ever he was the kite, never the
tail.  He loomed a large and growing figure in his little
world.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Above all, there seemed something uncanny in the
unvarying facility with which Rawn made money.
There is no real explanation of the difference in
money-making power, except that some men make
money and some do not.  Rawn did, without any
doubt or question.  Not lacking ability and calmness
in judgment, and not lacking full information such as
is accorded those said to be upon the sacred inside of
the market, he was in and out of Rubber, Coppers,
Steel, at precisely the right time.  His oil investments
in California, played up and down in proper symphony,
had made him more than a million dollars, smoothly,
easily, simply.  The railways market was an open book
to him, and Public Utilities seemed something he could
gage while others stood and wondered.  There are
times when some men win.  Rawn could not lose,
whether he dealt in Ontario Silvers, Arizona Coppers,
anything he liked.  He was in with the pack when, in
these last fierce days of individual and corporate greed,
it finished pulling down a republic, and battened,
guzzled at the bowels of the quarry.  He partook with
these of a broad knowledge of the narrowing raw
resources of the country, and was in with them at the
death.  He was one of those to get hold of large
acreages of the passing timber lands, he was counted
with those who sought the great coal fields for their
own; ran true to scent, with these, the trail of
monopoly in any commodity which the people more and
more must need.  In the one matter of his relations
with a certain transcontinental railway, Rawn made a
quarter million as his share of the three-quarters of a
billion taken in sales of mineral lands from the
railway's land-grant holdings.  That the grants had
covered only agricultural lands mattered little, for when
the sleepy government at Washington reluctantly took
the trail, it was shown a law, cunningly passed a few
years earlier, which barred the republic, by virtue of a
six-year statute of limitations, from recovering any of
its own property!  John Rawn often laughed over
that.  He laughed also when the "suckers," as they
called them, bit just as eagerly at irrigation as they had
at mines.  He often laughed&mdash;it was all so ridiculously
easy to pull down a country, when the running was in
good company!  He was a prominent citizen.

CHAPTER VIII
<br />
A PRINCELY GENEROSITY
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rawn went on with the pack.  He was in
and out of the market.  His money grew.  His
ambition also grew.  He felt coming now upon him
another change.  He said to himself that he was now
about to pass up, into yet another era of his development.
</p>

<p>
One day, after his usual day's routine, he closed
his office door, took his car at the curb, dropped in at
his club, imbibed the two cocktails which were now his
evening wont, and again emerging, nodded to his
chauffeur in the fashion which meant "Home!"  They
passed on out again through the floating crowd of
various and often vulgar vehicles, northbound&mdash;shrieking
aloud in a vast united chorus, demanding speed,
speed, and yet more speed&mdash;along the throbbing
arteries of the city's population.  At last he stopped
once more at the front of Graystone Hall.  "Forty-five
minutes, Dennis," said he to his driver, snapping his
watch.  "Twenty-one miles; you'll learn it after a
while."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rawn was in exceptional good humor.  He was
at peace with the world and with his conscience.  He
looked about him now calmly, with approbation in his
gaze.  His gardeners had done wonders.  The walks
were solid and well kept, the greensward sound and
flourishing.  These late stubbed and desolate trees
were now wide, green and branching.  The crocus
borders were unbroken, the formal monochrome beds,
here and there upon the lawn, showed clean-cut and
distinct.  The tall pillars of his motley house even had
a green veiling of ivy, swiftly grown by art, and not by
time.  On a terrace a bed of foliage plant, thirty feet
long, grew in the shape of a word&mdash;a magic
word&mdash;"<i>Rawn</i>."  If any passer-by wished knowledge as to
the creator of all this, he might read as he ran&mdash;"<i>Rawn</i>."
</p>

<p>
Rawn passed up the steps and looked out through
the long hallway from the rear of the house, or rather
its real front, which lay upon the lake shore.  Beyond,
he could see the faint curl of the distant steamers'
smoke against the horizon.  He stopped for a moment,
drinking in the scene, of which he never tired.  There
were birds twittering softly in the trees about him.  He
caught the breath of flowers, coming to him from the
halls within.  Yes, it was an abode suited for a
prominent citizen.
</p>

<p>
There came to meet him now the quiet footfall which
he had come to expect, not always patiently or with
pleasure, as the natural end of his day's labors; his
wife, Laura, had never forgotten this daily greeting
of the old-fashioned wife to her husband, as the latter
returned at the close of his day's labor.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
He stopped as he heard her slow tread upon the
stair.  She was coming to meet him.  She always did.
He, John Rawn, controller of men, a man born to succeed
and going yet higher, had only, after all, an
old-fashioned wife!
</p>

<p>
It was an emergency this evening.  He was
accustomed to meet emergencies.  He had come to-night
prepared to meet this one.
</p>

<p>
"Laura," said he, after the servants had drawn the
curtains and left them alone in the central room,
whither they had repaired after dinner; "sit down here,
I want to talk to you a while."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, John," said she quietly.  But she looked at
him startled.  Her face grew suddenly grave.  Be
sure the brute advancing to the poll-ax knows its fate.
That was the look in Laura Rawn's face now.  "Yes,
John," she said, knowing what blow was to be hers.
</p>

<p>
He motioned her to a seat beyond the little table
and seated himself opposite.  Reaching into a bulging
pocket, he brought out a thick bundle of folded papers;
long, narrow papers, most of them green, others brown,
or pale pink.  He pushed this bundle across the table,
so that his wife must see it.  She reached out a hand,
but did not look at it.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, John?" she said.  Her hand tarried, her
face went still more weary and gray, became even of
an ashier pallor than was its wont.
</p>

<p>
"It's a trifle, Laura," said John Rawn.  "Look at
it.  There's bonds and gilt-edge dividend-payers for
just exactly <i>one million dollars</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"One million <i>dollars</i>, John!  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Look at it, see for yourself."
</p>

<p>
"But, John&mdash;what does it mean?"
</p>

<p>
"It means a great deal, Mrs. Rawn, a great deal for
you.  It took some work to make it on my part.  There
are not ten men in this town to-day who could draw
out of their business clean, unhypothecated securities
for a million dollars.  I've seen to it that all these are
registered in your name.  It's my gift to you, without
reservation."
</p>

<p>
"John, how could I thank you&mdash;but I don't want it!
I've not earned it, I wouldn't know what to do with it.
You're always so&mdash;so kind, John, with me.  But I
can't take it!  It's not mine!"
</p>

<p>
"It is yours, Laura.  And you've got to take it!"
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want to!"
</p>

<p>
"I want no foolishness," he said sternly.  "That
money is yours.  You can use it as you like.  Of
course, I will counsel with you as to reinvestment the
best I can.  I don't want to see the interest wasted.
</p>

<p>
"I don't ever want to see you in need," he went on.
"I don't counsel loose investments.  My lawyers will
also tell you what to do with your money, and they'll
put up to you a list of good, safe, savings-bank
investments, the kind that fools and sailors ought to have.
I'll help you choose, if you like.  I don't want to be
ungenerous.  This is your estate."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
"My <i>estate</i>!&mdash;But, John, I'm your wife!  I don't
care for this money.  I don't understand it, and I don't
want it.  I want to be your <i>wife</i>, John, the way I
always was&mdash;I want to help&mdash;I want to be useful to you
all the time, as I've always tried to be."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely, Laura, and I appreciate that feeling very
much.  I feel the same way.  I want to be as useful
as I can to you.  We have always been loyal to each
other, faithful with each other; I know that.  There
are not ten men worth my money in this town to-day
who can say what I can&mdash;that they've been faithful to
their wives as I have been to mine.  You've been a
good woman, and you've worked hard.  You say you
haven't earned this money, but I think you have.
We've been useful, yes, to each other.  But when we
can't be any more, Laura, why then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The tears burst from her eyes now.  He frowned,
that she should interrupt him, but went on.
</p>

<p>
"It shall never be said that I was unkind to you,
Laura.  Indeed, I shall always feel kindly to
you&mdash;always remember what you have done."
</p>

<p>
"But you don't, you <i>don't</i>, John!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't?  What do you mean by that, Laura?  Isn't
there the proof?  Isn't there a <i>million dollars</i> lying
right in front of you on that table?  And you say this
to me, who have just given you a cold <i>million</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"That's it, it's a <i>cold</i> million, John," said she bitterly.
"It's <i>cold</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Good God!  The unreasonableness of woman!"
said John Rawn, upturning his eyes.  "Now I've
thought all this out as carefully as a man can.  I've
denied myself, to take this much capital out of my
investments and set it aside for you.  I can make five
millions out of that money in the next five years.  But
no, I reserve it, and I give it to you without stint.  I
give it to you for your estate, so that you shall never
know want&mdash;more money than you ever had a right to
dream of having.  You do that for a woman, and what
does she say?  Why, she doesn't <i>want</i> it!  Good God!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"John," she said, struggling for her self-control,
"you might at least tell the truth."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean&mdash;the truth?"
</p>

<p>
"It's some other woman, of course!"
</p>

<p>
"I swear to you, Laura, it's nothing of the sort.
I've been guilty of no act with any one&mdash;"  But she
shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Don't I know?" she said.  "It's always another
woman.  She's a young woman, whoever she is.  Why
don't you come out and tell me the truth, John?  How
long before you're going to be married?"  The tears
were welling steadily from her eyes, under the last of
the many and bitter torments which are so often a
woman's lot.
</p>

<p>
"I say to you again, Laura, there are no plans of
that sort in my mind!"
</p>

<p>
"Then how long will it be before our&mdash;our&mdash;"  She
could not say the word "divorce."  She had been an
old-fashioned wife.
</p>

<p>
"I've no plans as to that.  I was only wanting to
discuss the matter quietly to-night, without any
disturbance."
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "I must not break down!  Tell me,
when does it come, John?"  But still the tears came,
steadily, and she made no effort to stop them.
</p>

<p>
"When you like.  I would suggest that you quietly
go to some other place, Laura.  That will be best for
me.  Why&mdash;" he added this in a burst of confidence,
"&mdash;there wouldn't be twenty people around town
would know you'd gone!  I can keep a close tongue,
and so can you."
</p>

<p>
"But, John, why should we?  I've never crossed you
in any way.  I've always tried to do what you liked.
Why should we part?  I'll be willing just to live along
here quietly.  I can't bear to think of going away.  I
like my things.  John," she said suddenly, and seemingly
irrelevantly, "who told you about all these things,
these collectors' pieces that you've been getting for so
long?"
</p>

<p>
He winced with sudden self-revelation, astonished
at this intuition on her part.  He had been sincere in
his statement that there was no other woman in his
affections.  He had only forgotten that he had no
affections.  He flushed now, but tried to pull together.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Laura," said he; "you only prove to me
what I've felt for some time.  You can't understand
me, you simply are not up to my requirements.  I'm
willing to say <i>you'd</i> be content to live along here, just
as we did at Kelly Row.  <i>I</i> am not content to do anything
of the sort.  I've been thinking over this, studying
over it for some time.  There's the answer."  He
nodded toward the bundle which lay upon the table.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
"It's no use trying to make the world all over again,
Laura," he said after a time.  "We've both done our
best, but our best didn't tally.  We've hung together.
What's right is right.  Is it right for me to be dragged
down by your own limitations&mdash;ought I to stop in my
own career to conform to that?  Would that be right,
now, Laura, for a man like me?&mdash;Is it right for any
man?  If you can't go forward, ought I to go back?
If we can't both travel the same gait, whose gait ought
to govern?  Whatever you do, don't blame me, that's
all.  But you <i>did</i> blame me&mdash;you do now."  A grave
look sat upon his face.  He felt himself an injured man.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, John," she said.  "I do."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, of course!  That's the reward a man
gets for loving his wife, treating you as I have.  Well,
we're not the first to face a situation of just this kind.
Things travel swifter now than they did when we were
children, or when we were married.  What did then
will not do to-day.  Why blame ourselves for that?&mdash;blame
the time, the way of the world, the way things
go to-day.  This country has changed&mdash;it goes faster
every year.  We've got to keep the pace, I tell you,
when we get into it.  Those who can't must drop out,
and that's all there is about it.  I was born for the
front, and that's all about that.  Don't blame me.  I've
never blamed you!"
</p>

<p>
"Then, what <i>do</i> you blame, John?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, I say.  It's the way life runs.  We're
married, why?  Because we thought we were to have
some property to protect.  There is much to be said
in favor of the marriage institution.  It holds property
safe under its contract.  <i>Property</i>&mdash;that's the sign of
power!  <i>Property</i> is the only reason for marriage; or
for government, when it comes to that.  <i>Property</i> is
the token of power.  I've got that!  But something
else goes with it!  Why, Laura, when I look at us
both I wonder that I've been patient so long, held back
as I have been by your own narrow ideas.  If you'd
had your way, you'd have set up Kelly Row right
where we are now!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
"I'm old-fashioned, John," said she, her head high,
though her tears fell free, "I'm just an old-fashioned,
worn-out wife, that's all.  I'm not so very much, John,
and I never thought I was very much.  I just did the
best I could, all the time.  I couldn't seem to do any
more, John.  I don't know how.  I did my best!"
</p>

<p>
"We all do!" said John Rawn philosophically.  "We
all do our best.  But when our best isn't good enough
to keep us up, we go down!"
</p>

<p>
He spoke generously, gravely, judicially.  He was
arbiter, in his own belief, not husband.  The country
had changed since they two had married.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there's much to be said for the institution of
marriage, Laura," he repeated after a time.  "In fact,
it is a necessity, as society is organized.  But divorce
is a natural corollary of marriage.  There are
contracts, and broken contracts.  That's all!"
</p>

<p>
"What is a&mdash;a corollary, John?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"It's a consequence; it is something that follows.  I
meant to say, that if it is right for two people to be
married, it is right for them to be divorced when the
time comes.  It's <i>property</i>, and the consequences to
property, which sometimes determine that!"
</p>

<p>
"But we said, John, when we were married&mdash;I
swore it with all my heart&mdash;'Till death do us part!'  It
isn't death.  I wish it were!"
</p>

<p>
"No, it's property," said John Rawn.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
"But all this serves no purpose," he continued.  "I
don't want to have you make this hard for me!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, God!  How you've changed, John, since the
old times!  How you've changed!"
</p>

<p>
"So that's it, is it?" he rejoined bitterly, "I've only
changed, and you're sorry that I changed.  Well,
suppose we agree to that.  I <i>have</i> changed!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you want me to do, John?" she asked
after a time, her breath still, in spite of herself, coming
in sobs.  "When do you want me to go?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow, Laura.  There's no use waiting."
</p>

<p>
"Very well; where shall I go?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I don't dictate to you, Laura&mdash;I leave that
all for you to determine.  You can be happy as you like,
and where you please.  I would only suggest, if you
ask me, that you take up a residence in some quiet
community, a sort of place that seems to suit you."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, John; I've not many friends here to
leave, that's true.  I've not been happy here; I never
would be.  I'll agree to that much.  I believe I'll go
back to our old town&mdash;I'd feel better there!"
</p>

<p>
"You've good judgment, Laura," he noted with
approbation.  "What you say has good sense about it.
Very likely you'd be more happy there than here.  But
wherever you go, don't forget your old husband, John.
Deep in my work as I shall be, I will always think of
you, Laura, with nothing but kindness.  I want you
to think that way of me&mdash;to remember that I've been
kind to you, always.  You will, won't you, dear?"
</p>

<p>
She did not seem to hear.  Her face was bowed
down upon her arms, flung out across the table.  She
was an old-fashioned woman, and still silly enough
to pray to the God who had placed her in this world of
puzzles.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
THE EXTREME MONOGAMY OF MR. RAWN
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
It is always more or less annoying to put away a
wife.  Even if the expense of the process be little,
as in these modern days it has come to be, and even if
consent thereto be mutual, as is so often the case, there
are in practically all cases so many unpleasant
attendant features as almost to dispose one to favor the
abolishment of the marriage idea, and to condemn it as
one not destined to survive in these days of modern
competition.  This, the more especially as regards that
monogamic idea of marriage which the government at
Washington harshly seeks to extend over our entire
domain.  As to the idea of polygamy, much may be
said in its favor.  Thus, if one be tired of one wife,
or bored by another, in polygamy it is easy to shift the
domestic scene to a third, and that in wholly
good-humored fashion.  The idea of divorce has about it
something almost personal, as though one were
displeased over some matter, as though one held in one's
heart something actually of criticism, or dissatisfaction,
or mayhap condemnation of one's own earlier
judgment in the selection of a helpmeet.
</p>

<p>
Again, even after divorce has been consummated,
there are so many small habits to be broken, heritage
and hold-over of relations but recently sundered.  For
instance, if one has been accustomed every Friday
evening to have shoulder of pork and boiled cabbage
at table, and if only one woman has evinced ability to
prepare shoulder of pork and cabbage in the proper
manner, and if that woman has chanced to be one's
lately current wife, it is, let us repeat, an annoying
thing to find that that particular woman, after
deliberately forming and fostering in one a craving for
shoulder of pork and cabbage&mdash;after having established
an addiction, as it were, in one's soul for that
viand&mdash;has with shameless disregard of wifely duty
and domestic decency obliged one to divorce her,
perhaps <i>ex vinculo</i>, or at least <i>ab mensa et thoro</i>.
</p>

<p>
And again there may be yet other habits upon the
one hand or the other which must be broken or
readjusted.  If one's wife&mdash;or one of one's wives&mdash;has been
in the habit of leaving her tatting each afternoon on
the top of the table near the best view out of the bow
window, and if one sees continually this abandoned
tatting permanently left there in the confusion of her
permanent departure&mdash;it is annoying, let us repeat, to
be reminded of a habit to whose creator we have said
farewell.  It causes a mental ennui constantly to be
removing tatting or embroidery.
</p>

<p>
Or, if one's current wife has had the old-fashioned
and not wholly well-bred habit of meeting one at the
door of an evening, at the close of the day's
labors&mdash;just as in the evening the cave woman greeted her
man at the mouth of the cave to ask him what had
been the fortune of the day's hunt&mdash;and if now that
footfall, ill-bred, yet after all habitual&mdash;and was it
wholly unwelcome, after all?&mdash;shall have ceased for
ever, with what equanimity, let us ask, can we regard
the memory of the woman who formed that habit and
handed down an annoying expectation to her husband,
impossible of fulfillment after her departure?
</p>

<p>
It is, as John Rawn wisely has said, true that much
may be said in favor of the idea of marriage; yet upon
the other hand, how very much there is that could be
said against it, or at least against it as implying an
unrestricted continuance, offering no change in
association.  The which is by way of saying something to
prove John Rawn's excellently philosophical course in
life to have been quite correct.  There could have been
no doubt as to the wisdom of his marrying Laura, his
wife, in the first place, no doubt as to the wisdom of
continuing the marriage relation with her for many
years; but, upon the other hand, it is obvious that his
idea of the timeliness of the divorce in due season was
equally wise.  Indeed, the only reservation in his mind
in regard to this latter matter was one of censure for
a woman who, having entered into the holy state of
matrimony with a gentleman of his parts, had had the
temerity to create in his soul an addiction for shoulder
of pork and cabbage; who had left her tatting upon
the table; and who, departing, had given no future
address whither her tatting might be sent!  Yes,
Laura Rawn had been, without doubt or question, an
unreasonable and unkind wife.
</p>

<p>
Above all it was wrong for a woman to go away and
leave her late husband feeling so much alone.  Why
should he, John Rawn, be allowed to become conscious
of a feeling of lonesomeness?  Why should he be left
to dread the drawing of the curtains at night, when
there remained only the pound of the surf along the
wall, the wail of the wind in the cornice?  One
chloroforms a formerly prized dog, but misses it.  It
is much the same way with the divorced wife.  Too
many unpleasant features attend the process of such
separation.  Any civilization worth the name ought to
devise some method less annoying for this which
Mr. Rawn has so fittingly described as the corollary of the
marriage rite.  Surely our boasted age has its
drawbacks, its shortcomings!
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Some men in such circumstances brood; some drink;
others search out the other woman or women.  John
Rawn was cast in different mold.  He had, in short,
spoken truth when he told his wife that he had no new
matrimonial plans.  Situated thus, yet handicapped
thus in his new-found solitude, but a few days had
passed before he sent over for his daughter, Grace,
and her husband, Charles Halsey; there being in his
mind a plan to mitigate certain unpleasant features of
his life as he now found it ordered.
</p>

<p>
He greeted Halsey and Grace at the door gravely,
with dignity, when they came one evening in response
to his invitation.  They entered, just a trifle awed, as
they always were, by the august surroundings of
Graystone Hall, so different from their own cottage near
the factory.  The owner of the place looked well the
part of owner here.  John Rawn still was large and
strong, the city had not yet much softened his lines.
His hair now was whiter about the temples, but its
whiteness left his appearance only the more
distinguished.  You scarce could have found in all the
haunts of prominent citizens a better example of
prominent citizen than himself, John Rawn.
</p>

<p>
The major domo took the wraps of the young people
and vanished silently.  Rawn, waiting for them in the
drawing-room&mdash;not in the hall, as once he would have
done&mdash;with dignity motioned them to places in his
presence, even brought a low chair himself for the
sad-faced, hunchbacked child which represented the
Rawn succession in the third generation.
</p>

<p>
"Go kiss grandpa, Lola!" said Grace to her daughter;
and went to show her the way.  But the child,
turning suddenly, only hid her face in her mother's
skirt.
</p>

<p>
"Laura's timid," apologized the mother.  The
disapproval on her father's face was obvious enough.  He
had passed bitter hours alone, pondering over this
child, hesitating whether to love it or to hate it,
whether to accept it or to regard it as a blot upon his
life.  He had hoped a grandson, since he no longer
might hope a son of his own.  This crippled child was
the sole Rawn succession.  His pendulous lower lip
trembled for a time in the self-pity which now and
again came to John Rawn.  It seemed hard enough that
he, John Rawn, president of the International Power
Company, should have no better evidence of gratitude
on the part of fortune.  He hated Halsey all the more.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
But now he did not lack directness.  "Grace," he
said, "I've called you over to-night because to-morrow,
as you know, is Friday."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Pa."
</p>

<p>
"And as you know, Grace, your mother&mdash;that is to
say, the late Mrs. Rawn, always had the way&mdash;in
short, I may say that she induced me to depend upon&mdash;I
mean to say that always she had shoulder of pork
and cabbage for Friday evening.  Now, I am left
alone, helpless&mdash;it is too much!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rawn made no attempt wholly to conceal his
just emotion.  "Now look at me," he resumed.  "Your
mother went away, and selfishly neglected to take into
consideration this habit, or to provide any means for
meeting it.  My chef has tried often to prepare this
dish.  I must say he always has failed."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you write to Mrs. Rawn and ask her
for the recipe?" asked young Halsey soberly.
</p>

<p>
"That is not practical," rejoined Mr. Rawn icily,
"even did I know that lady's present address; as I
do not."
</p>

<p>
His daughter sat gazing straight at him, under her
heavy brows, but made no comment.  Grace had not
improved with years.  Her face was heavy, pasty,
her expression morose.  The corners of her mouth
turned down, and deep vertical frown-wrinkles sat
between her dark eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"But I do not wish that name mentioned again,"
said John Rawn raising a hand.  "I dismissed that
thought of asking her aid as something unworthy of
me.  Let Friday come.  I shall seek no aid outside of
those from whom it may fitly be expected."  Ah, hero!
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"Now, Grace," he continued later, turning toward
her, "I know very well you're a good housekeeper."
</p>

<p>
"She is that!" Halsey nodded.  Continually he
forced himself into such approval of his wife as he
could compass.  Continually he refused comparisons.
</p>

<p>
"Precisely, and skilled in all the dishes which the
late Mrs. Rawn had as specialties.  You do not know
how things are running here, Grace.  I can't get
anything done on time, I'm at untold expense all the time,
and am deprived of what I really want.  Grace, I need
a housekeeper!"
</p>

<p>
"Surely, Pa.  Why don't you hire one?"
</p>

<p>
"How much better off would I be in that case?
None in the least.  No, I want you.  You'll have to
come over here to live!"
</p>

<p>
The young couple sat gazing at him for a time
before making reply.
</p>

<p>
"That's impossible, Pa," said Grace.  "I have a
home of my own, and it's more than twenty miles from
here."
</p>

<p>
John Rawn raised a hand.  "I have thought all that
out.  You reason now, as so many do, when any
distinct change of life is proposed to them.  You let
the little things outweigh the larger ones.  It was a
fault your mother had.  Now the large matter, the
really important thing, is this&mdash;that I can not be
allowed to live on here in this way with all these
annoyances.  Too much depends upon me, in business,
for me to have the quiet and peace of my life interfered
with.  I've got to have a clear head&mdash;especially
on Saturday.  Now, then, if you can step in here, my
daughter, and establish in some measure the sort of
life I have always been used to, evidently that is your
duty, and you ought not to balance against it the small
inconveniences which that course would cause you and
your husband.  I'm quite sure you can teach that
chef&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, Mr. Rawn, I've got to be at the factory almost
day and night!" broke in Halsey.
</p>

<p>
"Precisely.  I do not mean for you to make your
home here, only Grace.  You'll have to stay on where
you are.  Of course, you can come here at times to
report, at least once or twice a week&mdash;say Friday
night.  Very much depends on you, Charles.  You
know how much I value you, how much I rely on your
services.  Really, it all depends on you, our success as
a company.  We've been very patient, although I must
say&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Halsey muttered something under his breath and
turned away.  His attitude angered Rawn to the point
of forgetting himself.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind what you think about it, young man!
It's what <i>I</i> think about it that counts.  Grace belongs
here, anyhow.  She will have a wider life with me.  It's
time she had some things which she has never known.
It may be necessary for us to travel, to see something
of this country and Europe.  Besides, this child needs
care.  All these things cost more money than you can
afford, young man.  Don't try to balk me in what I
suggest.  It is obviously the right thing to do."
</p>

<p>
"But how long&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Indefinitely!"
</p>

<p>
"And you want me to break up my home 'indefinitely'?
Well, I must confess I don't in the least see
it that way, Mr. Rawn."
</p>

<p>
"You're selfish, and that's why you can't see it,
Charles.  Above all things you ought to avoid the vice
of selfishness.  You are not parting from your wife,
but only helping her to a better grade of living.
Meantime, of course, your duty to her and to the company
is to make a success of your work.  Think of your
business, my son.  There is no good comes of selfishness.
Try to be just.  And for God's sake, also, try to
get one of those machines done!"
</p>

<p>
Halsey only sat and looked at him darkly for a
time, making no reply.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me that I can never get you to understand,
Charles," resumed Rawn, "that things are not
the way they used to be before we came here to
Chicago.  I'm a bigger man now than I was then.  I've
grown these last two or three years, my boy.  I should
not be surprised if eventually I were obliged to make
my residence in New York, if indeed not abroad.  We
are rising in the world, rising very fast, Charles.  Do
you want to go up with the Rawns, or stay down with
the Halseys of this world?  Besides, in this case you
ought to respect the wishes of your own wife.  You
want to remember, my dear boy, that my daughter,
Grace, is half Rawn as well as half Johnson.  The only
trouble with her is, the Rawn half has not yet had its
innings."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
Halsey turned and stared at his wife.  He found
her sitting with her dark eyes fixed, now on her father,
now wandering hither and yon over the rich surroundings
in her father's home.  To his intense surprise, she
had as yet issued no veto to this calm proposal to
which they all had listened.  In his surprise he forgot
comment of his own.  What caused him greatest surprise
of all was his secret feeling that he was not so
reluctant to this arrangement as he ought to be!  He
pondered Grace, her sour visage, her morose air.  He
recalled countless angry, irritated, irritating words.  He
looked, and saw no longer any feminine charm.  It took
all his resolution not to question why he had ever made
this choice.  Almost he began a certain comparison.
</p>

<p>
"Now let this end it," resumed John Rawn.  "Let
comforts, and let luxuries, come where they have been
earned.  It's the Rawn half of Grace that has earned
the luxuries, Charles, if I am willing to give them to
her.  Take what you can get, my son, of comfort and
luxury in this life&mdash;after you've earned them.  But
earn them first.  Your place is over there at the works.
This is your opportunity.  Fall in with my plans and
I'll carry you along.  Don't try to hold Grace over
there when she belongs here.  Don't be selfish,
Charles."
</p>

<p>
He relented just a trifle.  "I don't say this is going
to last for ever.  Pull off success over there for us.  I'll
tell you what I'll do&mdash;the day you can charge a storage
battery car from one of our second current
receivers&mdash;finished and in place there in the factory&mdash;and run
it from the factory up here, I'll make you a present of
fifty thousand dollars."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
"And about Grace&mdash;?"  Ah! that comparison&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"She'll be a good deal closer to you then than she
is now.  She's half <i>Rawn</i>, I tell you, Charles; and love
in a cottage does not suit the Rawn blood to-day!
</p>

<p>
"But I'll tell you&mdash;" his face lightened a bit at the
jest&mdash;"you can go on with your brotherhood of man
ideas over there at the factory.  I hope you love
them&mdash;those brothers who are trying to ruin me and this
company!  Try them out&mdash;associate with them&mdash;love
them all you can.  Compare that life with this, my boy;
and when you've done your work, for which you are
paid&mdash;when you can charge one car at one receiver,
and come from that life to this, on the strength of your
brains and your own ability, as I have come here
myself&mdash;why, I say I'll give you a slice of a million
dollars!  Then you can compare that life with this, and see
how you like the two.  I've made up my mind already
about that!  So has Grace."
</p>

<p>
Halsey turned once more to his wife.  She had
changed in the last few minutes.  Her eye was
brighter, her color higher.  She was gazing not at her
husband nor at her child, but at these rich surroundings.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if I could play one of my old pieces on
the piano any more now?" she said gaily, rising and
walking to the seat of the grand piano which stood
across the room from them.  "I've been so <i>busy</i>&mdash;"

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
ASPARAGUS, ALSO POTATOES
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
What is written is written.  Grace moved to
Graystone Hall and Halsey remained at the
factory cottage; nor did the separation, which was
regarded by both as merely temporary after all, afflict
either to the extent that both had supposed it would.
Grace now became acting mistress of a large and
elaborate <i>m√©nage</i>.  As to her husband, his domestic
affairs fell into the hands of Mrs. Ann Sullivan, wife
of Jim Sullivan, Halsey's most trusted foreman in the
factory.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sullivan, blessed with six children of her own,
alleged that it would be no trouble whatever to her
to take on the sweeping, mending, and all else for an
additional household, and to furnish meals for the
solitary head thereof; and such was her ability to make
proof of all these statements that she in part was to
blame for the sad truth that Halsey was not as
unhappy as he ought to have been.
</p>

<p>
The chief reason for Halsey's easy readjustment,
however, lay somewhere in his comparison of the
Halsey blood with blood half Rawn.  Grace had been
cold, after all.  She had openly been discontented, and
especially unhappy since the birth of the deformed
child.  She had left him and gone to her father with
no great protest; nor did she, at the occasions of their
rare and lessening visits, display more than lukewarm
interest in her husband and her former home.  Within
six months she was beginning to blossom out in
raiment, in demeanor.  She spoke of things not in his
knowledge though in hers.  She was changing.  She
was going up in the world.  He, for the time at least,
was doing no better than to stand still; as the factory
now was doing, and International Power, also&mdash;marking
time, waiting for something.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Ann Sullivan was not a bad philosopher, besides
being a good cook, and at times she did not hesitate
to engage Mr. Halsey in conversation when they met
at this or that time of the day; as when by chance, one
noontide when he came home for lunch, he found her
sweeping down the front stair.
</p>

<p>
"You're lookin' lonesome to-day, Mr. Halsey," she
remarked without much preliminary.  "You're fair
grievin' for your wife, I suppose?  But why should
you expict anny woman to stay here whin she has such
a Pa, with such a house as her Pa has?"
</p>

<p>
"Would you have gone over there, Mrs. Sullivan?"
asked Halsey, stopping and feeling in his pocket for a
pipe of tobacco.  It was a question they often had
discussed.
</p>

<p>
"Would I?  In a minnit!  I'd lave Jim Sullivan
for iver if I'd one chanct such as your wife had."
</p>

<p>
She grinned, but her look belied her speech.
</p>

<p>
"What I'm wantin', Mr. Halsey," she went on, "is
what anny woman wants.  I want a di'mond star to
wear on me head whin I'm sweeping flures.  I need
di'mond earrings and bracelets to wear whin I'm
makin' your beds, you mind; and a silk dress that
hollers 'I'm a-comin'!' whin I start out to scrub the
steps.  Ain't it the truth, Mr. Halsey?  Ain't that
what ivery woman in the wurrld, at laste in America,
is wantin'?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure," nodded Halsey.  "Don't forget the
automobile while you're wishing."
</p>

<p>
"True it is!  Whut woman of anny social position
has not got her awtomo<i>beel</i> to-day?  Luk at me.  If
I had me rights, I'd have me electric bro'om brought to
the coorb ivery mornin' for me to go to market; and
ivery evenin', after I'd got me sweepin' done, I'd have
me long gray torpedy corm around to take me and Jim
out fer a fast spin up the bullyvard.  Me with
di'monds on my hair, with rings on me fingers an' bells
on me toes, a-settin' there an' lukkin' scornful.  Oh,
I was born in Ireland, but I'm American now.  The
day Jim Sullivan gives me what is me due, and I git
me first awtomo<i>beel</i>, 'twill be the proud day fer me&mdash;the
day whin I'm first fined fer vi'latin' the speed law
of the city.  'Tis a great counthry this!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sullivan grinned happily at her romancing;
but presently set her broom against the door-jamb and
turned to speak more in her real mind.
</p>

<p>
"Anny woman wants to blackguard a little once in
a while, Mr. Halsey, sir, and all women like to lie twice
in a while.  I'm just lyin' to you now, because the
birds is singin' and the weather is so fine.
</p>

<p>
"Listen!  Anny woman that's goin' to be happy is
goin' to be happy because of the stomach she has for
eatin', and the joy she has for dancin', and the heart
she has for love of her man and her childern.  And
anny woman that has her heart in the right place is
goin' to stand by them and not by herself; and not by
anny one ilse.  Try me and see if I'm lyin' now!
You're the boss.  Fire Jim Sullivan to-day, and see do
I stick with him, or do I go with some man that gives
me di'monds, and awtamo<i>beels</i>.  I'd stick&mdash;and so'd
anny other woman that loved her man and her childern."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you think so, Mrs. Sullivan."
</p>

<p>
"You know I think so!  Oh, maybe it's because I
wasn't born in this country.  Over there, 'tis the
woman helps to make the stake.  Here, she helps to
spend it.  'Tis a fine counthry this&mdash;fer policemin.  So
far as bein' happy in it's concerned, I dunno!
Maybe it's the Irish in me that's happy, and not the
American.  I dunno again.  'Tis all a question which
you want to be, rich or happy!"
</p>

<p>
"Or useful!" ventured Halsey.
</p>

<p>
"They're the same.  Bein' useful is bein' happy.
Ain't it the truth?"
</p>

<p>
Halsey nodded again and Mrs. Sullivan reached
once more for her implement of industry.
</p>

<p>
"Jim Sullivan fits in his job," said she.  "He's
strong and can hold his job all right.  I'm strong, and
I can hold mine here, just the same.  We've only six
childern, and I wish 'twas a dozen.  No, it's no trouble
to take care of this house, too.  I'm only thinkin' of
that little lamb of yours she tuk away with her.  'Tis a
mother she nades."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't, Mrs. Sullivan," said Halsey quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I mane no harm, and I'm feelin' fer you, me boy,
you havin' a crippled child to face the world where
even the strong has hard enough times ahead.  Still,
she'll have money, maylike!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mrs. Sullivan, I'm not sure of that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course it's none of me business&mdash;of course not.
But only look at the sky and only hear the birds
this mornin'!  You're young, and God may give you
two yet the dozen that I have longed for, denied as I
do be with only six.  You'll be goin' up yerself some
day, with all thim rich folks, Mr. Halsey, boy.  I'm
stayin' here with Jim Sullivan.  Whin we can't afford
sparrowgrass we eats potaties."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"But tell me, Mr. Halsey," she went on shrewdly,
"how long will we be havin' even potaties to eat?  Ye
don't keep min there in the factory long&mdash;there's not
many at wurrk now.  Besides, there's no smoke in
thim chimbleys!  And 'tis time.  <i>What's the mystery
there, boy?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"A good deal of labor troubles," commented Halsey
non-committally.
</p>

<p>
"More than <i>that</i>!" she insisted, drawing close to
him.  "Listen!  I mean well to you, boy, and so does
Jim.  He'll stick.  But Jim told me the night that
he could walk out, and pick up a clean tin thousand
dollars fer the walkin'!"
</p>

<p>
Halsey controlled himself.  This was news of
staggering sort.  "Why doesn't he, then, Mrs. Sullivan?
That's a good deal of money," he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, why doesn't he?&mdash;with me half American and
gettin' more so aich year,&mdash;me a-needin' di'monds and
awtomo<i>beels</i>!  The fool Irish!  'Tis maybe his ijiotic
idea he ought to stick."
</p>

<p>
Halsey made no answer except to look over at the
gaunt factory buildings.  A blue-coated figure was
pacing back and forth before the door.
</p>

<p>
"There's Jim Sullivan workin' inside, and there's
Tim Carney walkin' beat outside," she resumed; "and
the pickets tryin' to break in, and some one <i>else</i> tryin'
to break in.  What's it about, Mr. Halsey?  For the
company?  <i>What's</i> the company?"
</p>

<p>
"It furnishes asparagus for some, and potatoes for
others, Mrs. Sullivan."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, does it, thin?  Does it mind that potaties costs
more than they did, and so pay us better, or worse,
for what we do?  If what we eat goes up, we can't
live; and if we can't live, them that can has got to
support us somehow.  Ain't it the truth?  What's the
ind of it, me boy?
</p>

<p>
"I'm not askin' about the justice of it, but about the
business of it.  If our men starve, what'll we do?
Mr. Halsey, sir, we'll raise hell!  That's what we'll do!
Too much asparagus in this country, and too few
potaties, and thim of a bad class, is goin' to raise hell
in this counthry.  Ain't it the truth?
</p>

<p>
"Luk at Jim workin' there.  And luk at Tim protectin'
of him.  'Tis fine, isn't it?  I'm thankin' God,
meself, there's birds and sunshine in the world.  If
it wasn't for thim and the priest, I'm wonderin'
sometimes what us poor folks would do."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
"The theory is that some men are born stronger than
others, Mrs. Sullivan, and so entitled to the
asparagus," smiled Halsey.
</p>

<p>
"Is it so?  Jim Sullivan yonder is strong in what
makes a man.  In what makes a woman I'm strong.
Hasn't God got a place fer us, as well as Mr. Rawn?
And if God don't give it, haven't such as us just got
to <i>take</i> it?&mdash;I don't mean the asparagus, but just
the potaties?"
</p>

<p>
"But I've said enough," she went on, turning
suddenly.  "'Tis only because I'm fond of you, me boy,
that I've said so much.  There's devilment and mystery
goin' on here.  I don't ask you what your mystery
is, so don't ask me what is mine.  Jim's likely to stick,
and so am I.  'Tis likely we can be useful in the world,
and as for bein' strong, we're strong enough to have
each other.  And as I was sayin', we've the birds and
the sunshine&mdash;and the priest!  So take your mystery
you've got in there, and match it up with mine.  L'ave
Jim Sullivan alone, and when these two mysteries git
together, yours and ours, why, maybe there'll be <i>hell</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Halsey did some thinking when he was alone.  He
knew now, and had known, that something, somebody
besides the pickets of the labor unions, had an eye on
this mysterious factory of theirs.  He had felt for a
long time that there was an enemy working somewhere,
that a spy was making definite attempts to get
secret information.  Now, this unknown enemy was
able to offer ten thousand dollars bribe money.  The
case was serious enough.
</p>

<p>
It was worse than serious.  He had been sufficiently
warned.  Why, then, his pipe cold in his teeth, did he
sit staring now and think of things altogether apart
from the factory?  Why did he dream of the birds and
the sunshine?  Why did comparisons still force
themselves into his mind, and why did he long for
something life had not yet brought to him&mdash;something that
Ann Sullivan and her man owned, though they had so
little else?

CHAPTER III

THE SILENT PARTNER

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
There are men who make a living, sometimes a
very good one, through the process of teaching
others to do what they themselves can not do.  You
can purchase for a price in any of many quarters
printed maxims embodying full formula covering the
secret of success; in each case from one who has not
succeeded.  Nothing is cheaper than maxims, in type,
in worsted, or in transparencies.  To be in the fashion
you should have certain of these above your desk, and
should incline your ear to those who profess to teach
what can not be taught even by those most nearly
fitted to teach.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn cared little for maxims, being above
them, in his own belief, at least.  In all likelihood he
had never read the advice of the philosopher, to wit:
that each man should hitch his wagon to a star.  No,
he knew something better.  He hitched his to a river.
</p>

<p>
Very naturally, John Rawn selected the largest river
that he could find.  His silent partner was none less
than the Father of the Waters!
</p>

<p>
There is this to be said about a river, that it is
wholly tireless and immeasurably powerful; that it
enters into no combinations against capital, and does
its work without unseemly disturbances.  Rawn was
wise enough to know these things, nor asked any
maxims to advise him therein.  In his belief it was
better to allow this sort of silent partner to furnish the
industry and the economy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Who shall measure the power of a river, for ever
falling to the sea?  How many millions of horses and
men has it equalled in its wasted power in each generation,
in each decade, in each year?  Certainly sufficient
to lift the entire burden of labor from the shoulders
of the world.
</p>

<p>
What mind can measure the extent of such a force,
or dream the possibilities of its application, if it could
be set to work?  What equivalent of human brain and
brawn could be valued against this careless, ceaseless
power, derived endlessly from the air and the
earth&mdash;power given to the peoples of the earth before the
arrival of our present political and industrial masters;
given them in the time when the earth was the Lord's
and the fullness thereof.  The minerals under the earth,
the food produced in the soil, the waters offering paths
and power&mdash;before the earth and its fullness passed
from the hands of the Lord into those of our present
masters, these, it may be conceived, were intended as
the Lord's gift to the peoples of the earth.  That,
however, was quite before the advent of John Rawn.
</p>

<p>
Toil has always been the human lot.  We have
carried the mechanical burdens as well as the mental
burdens of life on our own human bodies and souls;
although all the time thousands of patient giants were
waiting, willing to serve us.  John Rawn could see
them waiting.  He knew to whom one day would be
due the power, and the kingdom, and the glory.  He
could look toward the white-topped mountains,
foreseeing the day when they would be put under tribute,
because they breed tumbling waters of immeasurable
strength and utility.  Their heritage of beauty and
majesty is naught to minds such as that of John
Rawn's.  Utility is the one word in the maxims of
such as these, men beloved of the immortal gods.
</p>

<p>
We speak of kings, of emperors, but what emperor
in all the history of the world had servants such as
these, submissive giants such as these, to work for
him?  We speak of miracles of old.  What miracles
ever equaled the business wonders, the money-piling
miracles, of the last twenty years in America?
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Where gat this silent partner of John Rawn's its
own tremendous power?  Out of the sun and the earth,
the parents of humanity.  The raindrop on the leaf,
shot through with the shaft of the sun, fell to some
near-by rill and, joined by other rills, marched on,
alive, tireless, tremendous, toward the sea.  Even far up
toward their source, had your little boat lodged,
counter to the current, on some rock or snag, and had
you attempted to push it back against the thrust of the
downcoming waters, you might have got some knowledge
of the power of even a little stream.  Ten feet
below you, that power again would have been quite
as great; and ten feet below that again as great; and so
on, to the sea.  It required the advice of no professional
maxim makers to teach a few of our great men, our
specially endowed superiors, John Rawn first among
them, that this power one day must be used.  In
accordance as it shall be used, the burden of humanity
may be lifted from human shoulders, or thrust
crushingly down upon them until indeed humanity shall
cease to hope.  The earth and its fullness are no more
the Lord's to-day.  They are John Rawn's.
</p>

<p>
The simple plan of the International Power
Company, was to make some strong obstruction inviting
the enormous resistance of the Father of the Waters,
tantalizing that power into being.  Thus, in a manner
perfectly simply, this force, once evoked and utilized,
would turn numberless wheels endlessly, tirelessly.  So
much for the material side of manifested power.  The
essence, the soul, the intangible spirit of that material
power was, in the plans of International, to be
transmitted by wire at first, and later through the free
air.  Its sale in definite and merchantable quantities
would come as near to the solution of the problem of
perpetual motion and perpetual profit as may be
arrived at in this world of limitations.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Rawn asked nothing better than this idea.  It was
beautiful, and he valued it over all his many and
various other ventures.  He could let his silent partner
put other men out of work; and so these could be
rehired at such price as he himself cared to set.  He saw
the time approach when he would be able to retail at a
price, remote from his silent, tireless partner's labors,
merchantable packages of power, to feed a cart, a
plow, a wheel of any sort; power to lift and labor, to
toil ceaselessly <i>without remonstrance</i>.  It was and is
a splendid dream.  Its bearing is as you be Rawn or
Halsey.  That power shall labor for or against mankind
as ourselves shall say.
</p>

<p>
Shall we blame ourselves, or John Rawn, in this
republic, that he saw on ahead only limitless personal
power, limitless gold, jewels, wine, women, personal
indulgence of any sort that appealed to him?  Shall
we blame Halsey for dreading the issue of these plans,
delaying them all he could; clinging to the belief that
the earth was the Lord's and the fullness thereof; and
that the Lord gave it to all mankind?  And shall we
blame the stock-holders for being impatient at renewed
delays?  The wire transmission was installed, making
every man in the International rich.  Yet every man in
the secret of the real ambition of this company burned
inwardly at this enforced secrecy and this unseemly
delay.  The mysterious factory at the edge of the great
inland city still was silent.  The directors raged.  They
wanted to drain to the last drop the strength even of
this tireless giant.  They wanted to begin to bottle,
measure and sell, sell for ever, the very force which
holds the spheres in their places!  In time we shall
perhaps see completed what these men planned.  There
is no logical reason why, if one planet can be owned
by a John Rawn or so, yet others should not!
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
For a long time Jim Sullivan, foreman at the factory
of the International, wondered and pondered as
to the real intent of these strange machines which he
saw little by little growing up under the uncommunicative
direction of the superintendent, Halsey.  He
had never seen anything like them, with their vast
coils of insulation, their intricate cogs and wheels, their
centrally-hidden huge glass jars, and the long, toothed
ridge, like a delicate metal comb, which surmounted
the top of each.  There was something mysterious
about it all.  He was sure that Halsey did
something with these machines when the men were not
about.  The very air seemed throbbing with some tense
quality of mystery.  The men themselves were
suspicious, irritable.  Never was the air in any factory
more surcharged alike with ignorance and with
anxiety.  Man after man, good mechanic though he was,
quit the place simply because he did not know what
he was doing.  The feeling of mystery was tense,
oppressive.
</p>

<p>
On one certain Sunday morning Jim Sullivan
strolled over to the vacant factory.  He knew that the
superintendent had spent almost the entire night there
working alone on one of these mysterious machines.
It stood there now.  And&mdash;yes! it was different from
what it had been when Sullivan last saw it!  It was
now apparently complete, so far as he could tell.  There
was no one near it.  Halsey had gone home, to bed.  Of
late he had been very tired, pale, haggard; and he
always was at his work in the factory, when good men
slept, and knew light-winged dreams.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
Jim Sullivan, stood now looking at the grim, uncanny
machine, hands in his pockets, wondering.  He
looked about him, superstitiously.  There seemed to be
something in the air, he could not explain what.  He
turned, looking behind him, and tiptoed to the front
door, where Tim Carney, the blue-coated guardian,
stood leaning against the wall.
</p>

<p>
"Tim!" he whispered, although there was none to
hear.  "Come on in here!"
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Jim?" asked the watchman.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno; that's why I'm callin' you."
</p>

<p>
"Has anny wan broke into th' place?"
</p>

<p>
"Not as I know, but somethin's happened here.  I'm
figurin' 'twas the boss done it.  Come in and have a
luk, now.  He's gone home."
</p>

<p>
They stepped gingerly on across the floor, along the
row of unfinished machines, and paused at the one
farthest from the door, which had excited Jim's
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Here's where the boss worked all last night!"
whispered the foreman hoarsely.  "'Twas daybreak when
he come home, an' he was all in.  He's been workin' on
her before now, I know that.  I'm thinkin' she's about
done, belike!"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever kind of a spook joint is this, anyhow,
Jim?" demanded the watchman.  "What's she for, do
ye think now?"  They two, bullet-headed, hairy, heavy
and powerful, stood looking at this contrivance, whose
growth through many months they had been watching.
The value of it either could measure in comprehensible
terms.  It was worth ten thousand dollars to either of
them who would&mdash;and could&mdash;tell a certain man how
it was made.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno what she's for," answered Jim slowly,
"but I'm thinkin' it's no good at all.  It's the devil,
maylike.  Not that she's so big neither.  I could almost
turn her over with a pinch bar."  He pointed to an arm,
or lever, which stood at the side of the machine.  "She
looks somethin' like one o' them drills I used to run
in th' tunnel, time Hogan was mayor, do ye mind?
Whin we wanted to throw her in we pushed down an
arm, somethin' like this."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, Jim, 'tis you have the head fer machines.  I
dunno about thim at all," rejoined Tim, scratching his
head.  "But 'tis a shame we can't throw her in, now.
Manny a time I've wondered what 'twas all about in
here.  Why shud strangers be so anxious as to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She luks like a patent gate in a fince, as much as
annything else," commented Jim.  "But as fer throwin'
her in, how cud we?  She's attached to nothin' at all,
so there's nothin' to throw her into.  She's got no wire
or cord runnin' to her, unless belike it comes up
through the flure.  She looks like she was some sort
of motor, but how she's to run I dunno.  Now if she
was geared to annything, you cud throw her in, most-like,
by this thing here.  It luks like she was done, and
if she is, I don't know why the boss wud go away and
leave the roof open over her."  He pointed to a sliding
window in the roof directly above the machine.  He
then reached out and swung some of his weight upon
the end of the engaged arm or lever.  Then, to the
joint surprise of the two observers, a very singular
thing forthwith occurred.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
What happened, as nearly as either of them later
could describe it, might have been called a duplication
in large of the phenomena of Halsey's original motor,
with which he burst the fan in the railway office at
St. Louis.  There was a low crackling in the air, a
dancing series of blue flame points along the toothed
ridge.  Then began a low purr, as of a motor in full
operation.  They could see sparks emitted, somewhere
at the interior of the intricate machinery.  A living,
splitting, crackling roar filled the air about them&mdash;the
roar of the shackled river, far away, raging at the
violence done it!  A projecting shaft, fitted with a pulley
head, began to revolve, faster and faster, until its speed
left it apparently motionless.
</p>

<p>
Something had happened, they knew not what.  The
machine was alive!  Some force seemed to come down
out of the air, to locate itself somewhere within this
intricate mechanism.  They stood, two bullet-headed,
hairy, powerful men, looking at what they had done.
</p>

<p>
"Do ye mind <i>that</i> now?" gasped Jim Sullivan, and
wrenched at the lever, restoring it to its original
position.  The purring of the motor ceased, the blue
sparks disappeared, the roar subsided growlingly.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
"What was it?" demanded Tim Carney.  "Throw
her in again, Jim!"
</p>

<p>
"Not on yer life!" gasped Jim Sullivan.  "I dunno
what 'tis, but I'll take no chances with the divil an'
his works, on a Sunday leastways.  There's somethin'
<i>wrong</i> in here, I'm tellin' you, Tim.  What made her
go, I dunno.  She's under power, same like a
compressed air drill&mdash;but where'd she <i>git</i> her power?&mdash;the
divil's in it, that's all, Tim.  I'm thinkin' the best
we can, do is to git away from here.  Come, shut the
dure&mdash;an' watch it.  Me, I'm goin' to the praste ag'in
this very day!  I see now what that felly wanted!"
</p>

<p>
Jim Sullivan locked the door and left his friend
guarding it; then hurried across the street to the
superintendent's cottage.  Mrs. Sullivan, busy there
about her morning duties, would have stopped him,
but Jim would have no denial, and hastening up the
stairs to Halsey's bedroom, impetuously demanded
entrance.  Halsey, drawn, haggard, unshorn, greeted him,
half sitting up in bed.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong, Jim?" he demanded.  "Has anybody
got into the works?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, boy!" said Jim, his finger on his lips.  "You
need tell me nothin'.  But I know what it's all about."
</p>

<p>
Halsey sat looking at him dumbly.
</p>

<p>
"Fire me if you like, my son," went on Jim Sullivan.
"'Tis true I've done what I had no right to do.
Mr. Halsey, sir, <i>I throwed her in</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"You did <i>what</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"I throwed her in.  An' she worked&mdash;she worked
like a bird!  Then I throwed her out ag'in an' come
away an' locked the door.  Tim was there, too.  'Tis
none of my business.  But I've come to tell you the
truth, an' you can fire me if you like!  But it's hell, it's
harnessed hell ye've got in there.  An' others want to
stale it."
</p>

<p>
By this time Halsey was getting into his clothing
and only half listening to what his foreman said.
</p>

<p>
"What kills <i>me</i> is, I can't see <i>how</i> she works!  She
runs by herself all the time, chuggin' like a fire ingin.
But where does she <i>git</i> it?"
</p>

<br />

</p>

<p>
Halsey made no answer.  He was pale as a dead
man.  A few moments later they were hurrying down
the stair, across the street, and through the long,
deserted room with its rows of gaunt enginery.  They
stood before the completed receiver, whose motor so
perfectly had caught the power of the free second
current from the air&mdash;John Rawn's costless, stolen Power.
</p>

<p>
"What makes her go?" demanded Jim Sullivan.
"Fer what is the hole in the roof yon?"
</p>

<p>
Halsey turned to him.  "It's the Mississippi River
makes it go, Jim.  If we didn't leave a hole in the roof
how could the river get through?  Now do you
understand?"
</p>

<p>
"My boy," said Jim kindly, laying a large hand on
his shoulder, "you're off your nut, of course.  I don't
blame ye, workin' so long as ye have, an' worryin'.
'Tis a rest ye must be takin' now, or they'll be puttin'
ye in the bughouse fer fair!"
</p>

<p>
"You're right!" said Halsey.  "I think I'll just take
a little ride this afternoon.  Jim, come here and help
me.  I want to see if we can charge up this electric
car.  If I can do that, Jim, my boy, I'll be richer by
six o'clock than either of us ever dreamed of being!"
</p>

<p>
Shaking his head dubiously, the big foreman lent a
hand, and between them they managed to roll the car
into place.
</p>

<p>
"Want to throw her down again, Jim?" demanded
Halsey, motioning to the lever and grinning.  That
worthy shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'm scared of her, Mr. Halsey, that I am!"
</p>

<p>
"And well you may be!" was Halsey's comment.  He
himself threw down an arm on the opposite side of
the receiver.  This time the motor did not resume its
purring, the shaft did not revolve.
</p>

<p>
"She's bruk!" said Jim.  Halsey only pointed to the
blue tips of toothed ridge.  "No," said he, "she's only
doing another part of her work.  The power is going
into the auto's motor instead of this.  Two forms, you
see, Jim."
</p>

<p>
A faint spark showed at the transmitter connection.
"Come!" said Halsey.  "Let her work!  We don't need
to now."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IX
</p>

<p>
That afternoon, Charles Halsey took his seat at the
steering wheel of an electric car which had been
charged with power taken from the air without wire
transmission.  His task was done.  He had accomplished
what he had started out to do.  Throbbing beneath
him was Power, the power of yonder distant silent
partner, power taken from the earth, and the air,
and the water; power of the elements; and power now
definite, segregant, merchantable!
</p>

<p>
Halsey kicked in the gear and rolled out into the
street.  Pale, preoccupied, he hardly noted where he
was going; but found himself half automatically
directing the car through a maze of ill-paved, crowded
thoroughfares; until at length he reached the
West-Side boulevard system.  Thence he crossed the river
to the East, and headed north.  Strong and true, under
a limit charge, the motor purred beneath him.  The
mechanism of the car operated without defect.  Nothing
in the least seemed wrong at any particular, nor
did the car in any particular differ in appearance from
others of its humble and inconspicuous class.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
X
</p>

<p>
None the less, midway of one of the large parks
along the lake shore, young Halsey suddenly
disengaged the gear, cut off his power, and applied the
brakes.  He was perhaps half way from his home on
the journey to Graystone Hall....  For a little
time he sat in the car, pale, almost motionless, deep in
thought; careless of the passing throng of other
vehicles, the occupants of which regarded him curiously.
Then, suddenly, he threw in the gear again, turned
on the current; and, quickly turning about, retraced
his course.  He had been gone less than an hour when
he stood once more at the curb of his cottage near the
factory in the western suburb of the city.
</p>

<p>
"So you're back again, sir!" commented Jim Sullivan.
"An' did ye get all that sudden wealth ye was
tellin' me about, at all?"
</p>

<p>
Halsey sat staring at him for a time.  "No," said he,
"I've changed my mind.  I'm going to wait a while."
</p>

<p>
The foreman turned and tiptoed off to find his wife.
"Annie," said he, his voice low and anxious, "try if
ye can get the boss to bed, an' make him sleep as long
as ever he can.  He's goin' off his head, an' talkin' like
a fool.  Somethin's wrong here, that's sure!  Hell's
goin' to break loose, in yon facth'ry some day.  But
whativer comes, the boss is crazy!"

CHAPTER IV
<br />
THE BAKER'S DAUGHTER
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
A large part of our ambitious American population
is prone boastfully to ascribe its origin to one
or other of those highly respectable, if really little
known monarchs to whom is commonly accorded the
foundation of Old World nobilities.  We have built up
a pretty fiction regarding so-called blue blood, on the
flattering, but wholly unsupported supposition that
royal qualities are transmissible to the thirtieth and
fortieth generation; so that 'tis a poor American family
indeed can not boast its coat of arms, harking back to
royal days of Charlemagne or William the Conqueror.
It may be.  Their Majesties were active, morganatically
at least no doubt, much-married men!
</p>

<p>
But continually there arise disturbing instances to
upset us in our beliefs regarding aristocracy.  There
are so very many worthless aristocrats, in whom the
theory of descent did not work out according to
accepted schedule; and there are so very many worthy
but wholly disconcerting men who are not aristocrats&mdash;so
continually do Lincolns arise who, claiming nothing
of birth or breeding, show themselves to be possessed
of manhood, show themselves, moreover, masters of
those instincts and practices which go with the
much-abused title of gentleman; a matter in which not all
descendants of Charles or William join them.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
It is well known among theatrical managers that no
real lady can imitate a real lady.  The highest salaries
in ladies' theatrical r√¥les are paid to ladies who are
not ladies, but who play the parts of ladies as they
think ladies really would act in actual life.  If you seek
a woman to carry off a gown, one to assume such
really regal air as shall bring the name of William or
Charlemagne impulsive to your lips, find one still
owning not more than one of the requisite three
generations which are set as the lowest limit for the
production of a gentleman or a lady.
</p>

<p>
Continually in our American aristocracy&mdash;and in
that, <i>par consequence</i>, of Europe&mdash;we find ladies whose
fathers were laborers, shop-keepers, soap-makers,
butchers, this or that, anything you like.  So only they
had money, they did as well as any to wear European
coronets, to assist at royal coronations.  And, having
proved their powers in swift forgetfulness, they offer
as good proof as any, of the scientific fact that gentleness
of heart and soul and conduct are not things transmissible
even to the third or fourth generation, either
in America or Europe.  Your real aristocrat perhaps
after all, is made, not born.
</p>

<p>
As to Virginia Delaware, daughter of the baker,
John Dahlen, in St. Louis, she started out in life with
the deliberate intent of being a lady, knowing very
well that this is America, where all things come to him
or her who does not wait.  In some way, as has been
said, she had achieved graduation at a famous school
where the art of being a lady is dispensed.  She had,
indeed, even now and then seen a lady in real life; not
to mention many supposed ladies in theatrical life,
playing the part as to them seemed fit, and far better than
any lady could.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
The soul finds its outward expression in the body.
The ambition shapes the soul.  It was wholly logical
and natural that, having her particular ambition&mdash;that
of many American girls&mdash;Virginia Delaware should
grow up tall, dignified, beautiful, composed,
self-restraining, kindly, gracious; these being qualities which
in her training were accepted as properly pertaining
and belonging to all aristocrats.  We have already seen
that, put to the test, in the midst of our best
aristocrats&mdash;those who frequent the most highly gilded and
glazed hotels in New York&mdash;she was accepted unhesitatingly
as of the charmed circle, even by the head
waiters.  Had you yourself seen her upon the Chicago
streets, passing to her daily occupation, you also in all
likelihood would have commented upon her as a rich
young woman, and one of birth, breeding and beauty.
We have spoken somewhat regarding the futility of
mottoes and maxims in the case of an ambitious man.
As much might be said regarding their lack of
applicability to the needs of an ambitious woman.  Virginia
Delaware would have made her own maxims, had she
needed any; and had she been obliged to choose a coat
of arms, she surely would have selected the Christian
motto of "Onward and Upward."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
The best aid in any ambition lies in the intensity of
that ambition.  We all are what we really desire to be,
each can have what he really covets, if he will pay the
price for it.  In her gentleness with her associates, in
her dignity and composure with her employer, in her
conduct upon the street and in the crowded car, in all
situations and conditions arising in her life, Virginia
Delaware diligently played the part of lady as best she
comprehended that; because she had the intense
ambition to be a lady.  She continually was in training.
Moreover, she had that self-restraint which has been
owned by every woman who ever reached any high
place in history.  She kept herself in hand, and she
held herself not cheap.  Likewise, after the fashion of
all successful politicians, she cast aside acquaintances
who might be pleasant but who probably would be of
little use, and pinned her faith to those who promised
to be of future value.  Such a woman as that can not
be stopped&mdash;unless she shall, unfortunately, fall in
love.
</p>

<p>
If there was calumny, Virginia Delaware heeded it
not.  She accosted all graciously and with dignity, as
a lady should.  And all this time her great personal
beauty increased to such point as to drive most of her
fair associates about the headquarters' offices to the
verge of rage.  To be beautiful and aristocratic both
assuredly is to invite hatred!  It is almost as bad as to
be rich.  Miss Delaware allowed hatred to run its
course unnoted.  She needed no maxims over her
desk, required no ancestral coat of arms.  She was an
aristocrat, and meant to be accepted as such.  In all
likelihood&mdash;though simple folk may not read a woman's
mind&mdash;she saw further into the future than did
John Rawn himself.
</p>

<p>
There remained, then, as against the ambition of
Virginia Delaware, the one pitfall of love, and even
this she easily avoided.  Beautiful as she unquestionably
was, admired as she certainly was, if there had
been fire in this girl's heart for any man, she kept it
either extinguished or well banked for a later time.
She had gently declined the heart and hand of every
male clerk in the office.  She had chosen her own ways,
and was not to be diverted.  Cool, ambitious, perfectly
in hand, she went her way, and bided her time.
</p>

<p>
Cool, ambitious, perfectly in hand, John Rawn also
went his way in life.  Two more ambitious souls than
these, or two more alike, you scarcely could have found
in all the descendants of the two bucaneer-monarchs
we have named.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
And Rawn continually found something responsive
in the soul of this young woman, something that
never found its way into speech on either side.  She
was the type of devotion and of efficiency.  Gently,
without any ostentation, she took upon herself a vast
burden of detail; and she added thereto an unobtrusive
personal service upon which Rawn unconsciously came
more and more to depend.  Did he lack any little
accustomed implement or appliance, she found it for him
forthwith.  Did he forget a name, a date, a filing record,
it was she who supplied it out of a memory infallible as
a fine machine.  From this, it was but an easy step to the
point where the young woman's unobtrusive aid became
useful even beyond business hours.  John Rawn
had never studied to play in any social r√¥le.  Did he
need counsel in any social situation, she, tactfully
hesitant and modest, always was ready to tell him what he
should do, what others should do.  Had he an appointment,
it was she who reminded him of it, and it was
she who had made it.  Were there personal bills to pay,
it was she who paid them.  She presided over his
personal bank account, and there was no hour when she
could not have named the dollars and cents in his
balance.  Did he wish to avoid an unwelcome visitor, it
was arranged for him delicately and without offense.
Little by little, she had become indispensable, both in
a business and a social way&mdash;a fact which John Rawn
did not fully realize, but which she knew perfectly well.
It had never been within her plan to be anything less
than that.  She knew, although he did not, that John
Rawn also was indispensable to her.
</p>

<p>
Rawn came from no social station himself, and as
we have seen, had grown up ignorant of conventional
life, so that now he remained careless of it, as had he
originally.  He made it matter of routine now that this
young woman should attend in all his visits to the East
in business matters&mdash;where, in short, he could not have
got along without her.  There was talk over
this&mdash;unjust talk&mdash;and much amused comment on the fact
that the two seemed so inseparable.  Rawn did not
know or note it.  They literally were running together,
hunting in couple in the great chase of ambition.  Few
knew now what the salary of the president's private
secretary represented in round figures.  Certainly she
dressed as a lady.  Certainly also she comported
herself as one.  It was, in the opinion of John Rawn, no
one's business that he registered himself at the New
York hotels, and either did not register his companion
at all, or else contented himself with the wholly
descriptive word "Lady" opposite the number of the
room whose bills he told the clerk to charge to his
account.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
Never was there the slightest ground for suspicion
of actual impropriety between John Rawn and Miss
Delaware.  Abundance of bad taste there certainly was,
for Rawn, without explanation or apology to any,
always ate in company of his assistant, was constantly
seen with her on the streets, at the opera, the play.
He showed, in short, that he found her society wholly
agreeable upon every possible occasion.  If this was in
bad taste, if many or most, in the usual guess, put it at
the point of impropriety, John Rawn gave himself no
concern.  The Rawn aristocracy began in him.  He
founded it, was its Charlemagne, its William the
Conqueror, as ruthless, as regardless of others, as selfish,
as megalomaniac as the best of kings.  Here, therefore,
were two aristocrats!  They ran well in couple.
</p>

<p>
It is not to be supposed that a girl so shrewd as
Virginia Delaware could fail to realize the full import of
all this.  She let the slings and arrows fall upon the
buckler of her perfect dignity and her perfect beauty,
but she felt their impact.  She was perfectly in hand,
knew perfectly well her mind, knew perfectly well the
price she must pay.  She let matters take their course,
knowing that they were advancing safely and surely in
one direction, that which she desired.  She was more
skilled in human nature than her employer, saw deeper
into a man's heart than he had ever looked into a
woman's!
</p>

<p>
And then, at last, the life schedule of Virginia
Delaware was verified.  At last, the inevitable happened.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
On one of these many trips to New York, Miss
Delaware had been alone in her apartments at the hotel
for most of the afternoon.  In the evening, before the
dinner hour, she was summoned to meet Mr. Rawn in
one of the hotel parlors.  At once she noted his
suppressed excitement.  He scarce could wait until they
were alone, in a far corner of the room, before
explaining to her the cause.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like to say this, Miss Delaware," he began,
"but I've got to do it!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Mr. Rawn?" she replied in her
usual low and clear tones.
</p>

<p>
"There's been talk!"
</p>

<p>
"Talk?  About what?"
</p>

<p>
"Us!"
</p>

<p>
"About us?  What can you mean, Mr. Rawn?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"The world is so confoundedly small, my dear girl,
that it seems everything you do is known by everybody
else.  Of course, a man like myself is in the
public eye; but we've always minded our business, and
it ought not to have been anybody else's business
beyond that."
</p>

<p>
"You disturb me, Mr. Rawn!  What has happened?"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;But now, to-night, now&mdash;just a little while
ago&mdash;I met this fellow Ackerman&mdash;you know him&mdash;big man
in the company&mdash;used to be general traffic manager
down in St. Louis, on the old railroad where I
began&mdash;well, he was drunk, and he talked."
</p>

<p>
"What could he say?"
</p>

<p>
"He got me by the coat collar and proceeded to tell
me how much&mdash;how much&mdash;well, to tell the truth, he
connected your name and mine.  If he wasn't drunk&mdash;and
a director&mdash;I'd go down there yet and smash his
face for him!  What business was it of his?  Of
course, men don't mind such things so much.  But
when it comes to you&mdash;why, my dear girl!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
The truth has already been stated regarding John
Rawn; that, batrachian, half-dormant for almost half
a century, and then putting into business what energy
most men put into love and sex, he had passed a life
of singular innocence, or ignorance, as to womankind.
He had never countenanced much gossip about women,
because he had little interest in the topic.  The <i>grande
passion</i> marks most of us for its own now and again,
or is to be feared now and again; but the <i>grande
passion</i> had passed by John Rawn.  He was now
approaching fifty years of age.  Married he had been,
and divorced; but he had not yet been in love.
</p>

<p>
He now spoke to his like, his mate in the hunt, of
the opposite sex, a young woman who at that very
moment was as beautiful a creature as might have been
found on all Manhattan, a woman known in all
Manhattan now as the mysterious "Lady of the Lightnings,"
the goddess of the stock certificates of one of
the most mammoth American corporations, a creature
over whom Manhattan's most critical libertines were
crazed&mdash;and helpless; moreover, a woman who, out of
all those in the great <i>caravanserai</i> at that moment,
might as well as any have been chosen as the very type
of gentle breeding and of gentle womanhood alike.
But she had not yet been in love.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IX
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand, Mr. Rawn," repeated she
slowly.  "What possible ground could Mr. Ackerman
have had?  You surely don't think he could have
spoken to any one else?"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't put that past Ackerman when he's
drunk.  If he'd talk to me, he would to others.  And
you know perfectly well that when talk begins about
a woman, it never stops!"
</p>

<p>
"No, that is the cruel part of it."
</p>

<p>
Her voice trembled just enough, her eyes became
just sufficiently and discreetly moist; she choked a
little, just sufficiently.
</p>

<p>
"It is cruel," she said, with a pathetic little sigh, "but
the hand of every man seems to be against a woman.
Did you ever stop to think, Mr. Rawn, how helpless,
how hopeless, we really are, we women?"
</p>

<p>
He flung himself closer upon the couch beside her,
his face troubled, as she went on with her gentle
protest.
</p>

<p>
"All my life I've done right as nearly as I knew,
Mr. Rawn.  Perhaps I was wrong in coming to trust
so much to you&mdash;to depend on you so much.  It all
seemed so natural, that I've just let matters go on,
almost without any thought.  I've only been anxious
to do my work&mdash;that was all.  But this cruel talk about
us&mdash;well&mdash;it can have but one end.  I must go."
</p>

<p>
"Go?  Leave <i>me</i>?  You'll do nothing of the sort!
I'll take care of this thing myself, I say&mdash;I'll stand
between you and all that sort of talk."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn, I don't understand you."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
X
</p>

<p>
They sat close together on this brocaded couch
among many other brocaded couches.  Crystal and
color and gilt and ivory were all about them; pictures,
works of art in bronze and marble and costly
porcelains.  The air was heavy with fragrance, dripping
with soft melody of distant music.  She was beautiful,
a beautiful <i>young</i> woman.  He caught one glance
into her wide, pathetic eyes ere she turned and bent
her head.  He caught the fragrance of her hair&mdash;that
strange fragrance of a woman's hair.  Dejected,
drooping as she sat, her hands clasped loosely in her lap,
he could see the bent column of her beautiful white
neck, the curve of her beautiful shoulders, white,
flawless.
</p>

<p>
The flower on her bosom rose and fell in her emotion.
She was a woman.  She was beautiful.  She was
young.  Something subtle, powerful, mysterious, stole
into the air.
</p>

<p>
She was a woman!
</p>

<p>
Suddenly this thought came to John Rawn like a
sudden blow in the face.  It came in a sense hitherto
unknown to him in all his life.  Now he understood
what life might be, saw what delight might be!  He
saw now that all along he had admired this girl and
only been unconscious of his admiration.  God! what
had he lost, all these years!  He, John Rawn, had
lived all these years, and <i>had not loved</i>!
</p>

<p>
He reached out timidly and touched her round
white arm, to attract her attention.  She flinched from
him a trifle, and he also from her.  Fire ran through
his veins as from a cup of wine, heady and strong.
He was a boy, a young man discovering life.  The
glory of life, the reason, had been here all this time,
and he had not suspected it.  What deed for pity had
been wrought!  He, John Rawn, never before had
known what love might be!  He was the last man on
Manhattan to go mad over Virginia Delaware.
</p>

<p>
She drew back from, him, seeing the flush upon his
face, color rising to her own.  Indeed, the power of
the man, his sudden vast passion, were not lost upon
her, different as he was from the idol of a young girl's
dreams.  But Virginia Delaware saw more than the
physical image of this man beside her.  She knew what
he had to share, what power, what wealth, what
station.  She knew well enough what John Rawn could
do; and she gaged her own value to him by the flush
on his face, the glitter in his eye.
</p>

<p>
For one moment she paused.  For one moment
heredity, the way of her own people, had its way.  For
one moment she saw another face, different from this
flushed and corded one bent near.  It was for but a
moment; then ambition once more took charge of her
soul and her body alike.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
XI
</p>

<p>
The net was thrown.  Silently, gently, she tightened
its edges with the silken cords.  He loved her.  The
rest was simple.  She saw the world unrolling before
her like a scroll.  All else was but matter of detail.
Above all, she exulted in her strength at this crucial
moment.  She knew that love is dangerous for a
woman, always had feared, as any woman may, that
love might sweep her away from her own safe moorings.
She rejoiced now to see this danger past, rejoiced
to find her pulses cool and even, her voice under
control, herself mistress of herself.  She did not love
him.
</p>

<p>
But she drew back now apparently startled,
apprehensive.  "We must go, Mr. Rawn," she said; and
would have risen.
</p>

<p>
He put out a hand, almost rude in its vehemence.
"You shall not go!  I've got to tell you.  Sit down!
Listen!  We'll separate in one way, yes.  You're done
now with your clerking days for ever.  But you're
going to be my wife.  I want you; and, by God, I
love you!"
</p>

<p>
His voice rose until she was almost alarmed.  She
looked about in real apprehension.  She turned, to see
John Rawn's face convulsed, suffused, his protruding
lower lip trembling, his eyes almost ready to burst into
tears.  She might almost have smiled, so easily was it
all done for her.  Yet this baker's daughter dared to
make no mistake in a situation such as this!
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn," she began, casting down her eyes, although
she allowed him to retain her hand, "what can
you mean?  Surely you must be in jest.  Have you no
regard for a poor girl who is trying to make her way
in the world?  I've done my best&mdash;and now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Make your way in the world!  What do you mean?
It's made <i>now</i>!  Look down the list as far as you like.
Is there anywhere you want to go?  Is there anything
you want to do?  Can you think of anything I'll not
get for you?  Look at your neck, your hands&mdash;you've
worn those jewels almost ever since you selected them,
and no one else has, though I told you once there was
a string to them.  There's no string to them now.
The first time you wore them, down there in the
dining-room, below, I told you they were not yours,
that they were only loaned to you for one night, that
we were only both of us masquerading, trying
ourselves out!  I told you then you'd do; but I didn't
know what I meant.  I don't believe I loved you then,
although now it seems I always have.  I know I
always will.  Those things are nothing&mdash;you shall have
everything you want&mdash;handfuls of jewels.  There's
nothing you want to do that you shall not do.  You
can't dream of anything that I'll not get for you!  You
were made for me in every way in the world&mdash;every
little way, as I've come to know, little by little, all this
time.  But now, to-night, it's all come over me at once.
I don't know that I planned, when I came here, to do
more than to stand between you and talk!  But&mdash;this&mdash;caught
me all at once, I don't know how.  It's the
truth before God!  I never loved a woman before
now&mdash;I didn't know what it was.  Virginia&mdash;Jennie&mdash;girl&mdash;I
love you!  We're going to be married to-morrow!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn," she said, her voice trembling, "I must
ask you to consider well before you make any
mistake&mdash;a mistake which would mean everything for&mdash;for
me.  You have no right to jest."
</p>

<p>
"I'll show you who's in earnest!" he retorted, his
hand cruelly hard on her wrist as he forced her back
into the seat.  "We'll go home from here as man and
wife, that's what we'll do.  We'll go from the train,
not to the office, but to Graystone Hall.  I'll find a
preacher in the morning here.  It's wonderful!  I love
you!  If they want to talk, we'll give them something
to talk <i>about</i>!  Let them come to the Little Church
Around the Corner&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;and see <i>us</i>, you and
me!"
</p>

<p>
He had both her hands in his large ones now, and
was looking into her eyes, intoxicated, mad.  She
leaned just gently toward him.  Forgetful of their
situation, he caught her in his arms, and kissed her
full.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
XII
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn, how could you!" she said at last, softly,
seeking to disengage her hand.  "It's like a dream!  I
have worked so hard, so long.  Life has had so little
for me!"
</p>

<p>
"But you love me&mdash;you can?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Rawn!" she said, lifting her eyes to his
face, then gently turning them aside.
</p>

<p>
"You do&mdash;you have&mdash;tell me!  Confess it!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed now, ripplingly, her color rising, and
at least was spared that instance of her perjury.  John
Rawn accepted it as her oath.
</p>

<p>
They parted after a time, she scarce remembered
how, he to a couch which knew no sleep, she to one
that long remained untouched.
</p>

<p>
In her own room Virginia Delaware stood for a long
time before her mirror, in silent questioning of herself,
her brows just drawn into a faint vertical frown.  At
last she nodded approvingly, satisfied that she would
do.  A wave of sensuousness, of delight in her own
triumph, swept across her.  She stood straight, swung
back her shoulders, gazed at the superb image in the
glass through half-shut eyes.  There was no question
of it!  She was a very beautiful woman, stately,
gracious&mdash;and aristocratic.  So.  It was done.  She had
won.  She caught glimpses of the jewels blazing at her
throat.  She removed them and tossed them lightly on
the dresser top as she turned to call for her maid.
</p>

<p>
"Madam is very beautiful to-night," ventured that
tactful creature when at last she had performed her
closing duties for the day.
</p>

<p>
Virginia Delaware looked down upon her with the
amused tolerance of the superior classes.
</p>

<p>
"You may perhaps find a little silver on the dresser,
maid," said she graciously.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
THE ROYAL PROGRESS OF MR. AND MRS. RAWN
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
So they were married.  Graystone Hall at last had a
mistress worthy of its architect and decorator
when&mdash;love and affection and other good considerations
moving thereto, as the law hath it&mdash;the new Mrs. Rawn
moved into the place of the old Mrs. Rawn.  Thereafter
matters went at least as merry as most marriage
bells celebrating the nuptials of middle age and youth,
of wealth and beauty.
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Rawn had spent a million dollars to free
himself from one wife, he seemed willing to spend
much more in the process of taking on another.  It
became current rumor that the one great diamond show
of the western city was Virginia Rawn.  The sobriquet,
"The Lady of the Lightnings," passed from New
York to Chicago and became permanent there.  Not
that that lady delighted in display; but there were
occasional operatic or theatrical events which demanded
compliance with her husband's wishes, in which event
she blazed almost better than the best.
</p>

<p>
But, gradually, she showed the tastes of the aristocrat,
as alien to vulgar display as to crude manners.
Gradually the tone, color, atmosphere, of Graystone
Hall began to change.  The porcelains which
Virginia Rawn purchased were not large and gorgeous,
but a connoisseur would have called them worthy.
The vast and brilliantly framed paintings came down
one by one, and one by one masterpieces went up,
selected by one who knew.  The walks, the grounds,
took on simpler and cleaner lines.  Rawn of the
International got a new credit as a person of taste.  He
was accepted as a collector, a patron of the arts, a
connoisseur, in fact, yet more a worthy and a rising
citizen.
</p>

<p>
The hospitality of Mr. Rawn's mansion house also
now increased perceptibly, and, delighted that at last
numbers came to see him, Mr. Rawn at first did not
analyze those numbers very closely.  Even the fastidious,
many of whom came to be amused, were unanimous
in the feeling that Mr. Rawn's house, its furnishings,
its decorations, its pictures, its works of art, its
hospitality also, were beyond reproach.  The trace of
<i>gaucherie</i> was gone.  The spirit of the place was
delicately reserved, dignified, yet well assured.  The seal
of approval was placed upon Graystone Hall.  Who,
indeed, should smile at the man who had made so
meteoric a rise, who had by a few years of labor become
master of this mansion, its furnishings and its
mistress?  Who, upon the other hand, might smile at that
mistress, whose appearance upon the front page of the
leading journals of the city became now a matter of
course&mdash;a lady of such reserved tastes as led her to
forsake the larger marts, and to set the seal of fashionable
approval upon a little florist, a little modiste, a
little milliner all her own&mdash;even a little surgeon
hither-to unknown, who honored a little hospital and made it
fashionable, by taking there this distinguished patient
for a little operation?
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Rawn himself expanded in all this social success.
He saw doors hitherto closed, opening before him, saw
his future unrolling before him also like a scroll.  A
hundred times a week he walked to his young wife,
caught her in his arms, uxoriously infatuated with her
youth, her beauty, her aplomb, her fitness for this life
which he had chosen.  For once he almost forgot to
regard himself as a collector of beautiful objects, although
the truth was that his wife, Virginia, became more
beautiful each day, more superb of line, more calmly
easy in air, more nearly faultless of garb and demeanor.
She took her place easily and surely among the
young matrons of the wealthier circles of the western
city.  Whereas thousands of auto-cars had passed by
Graystone Hall and only a dozen stopped, scores now,
of the largest, drove up its winding walks and halted
at its doors.  The dearest dream of both seemed
realized.  The hunt in couple had won!  They had gained
what they desired; that is to say, self-indulgence, ease,
idleness, adulation, freedom from care.  What more
is there to seek?  And is not this America?
</p>

<p>
Gradually John Rawn had been losing the rusticity
which had accompanied him well up to middle age.
The city now began to leave its imprint.  The waistcoat
of Mr. Rawn gradually attained a curve unknown
to it in earlier years, so that his watch fob now hung in
free air when he stood erect.  His face was perhaps
more florid, his hair certainly more gray.  His skin
remained fresh and clean, and always he was
well-groomed, having the able assistance of his wife now
in the selection of his tailoring, as well as her coaching
in social usage.  They always looked their part.  At
morning, at noon, or at dewy eve, in any assemblage
or any chance situation, they both played in the r√¥le
assigned to them in their own ambitions.  Born of
environment wholly unconventional, they now took on
that of conventionality as though born to that instead.
You could not have found a more perfect type of
respectability than John Rawn, a more absolutely valid
exemplar of good social form than his wife, Virginia.
All things prospered under their magic touch, the genii
of the lamp seemed theirs.  No problems remained for
them to solve.  They had in their own belief attained
what may be attained in American life, and they
were happy.  Or, that is to say, they should at least
have been happy, if their theory of life and success,
and of those like to theirs, be correct.  At least they
were what they were&mdash;products of a wonderful
country which makes millionaires overnight and
produces out of bakeries women of one generation fit to
be the wives of princes born of forty kings.

<p>
We are, some of us at least, accustomed to worship
such as these as they ride by upon the high car of
success, accustomed to envy and to emulate them.  If that
vehicle be the car of Juggernaut, crushing under its
wheels multitudes of those who worship, it is no
concern of those who sit aloft.  For a long time Mr. Rawn
and his wife remained ignorant of the fact that one
victim under the wheels of their success was none other
than Mr. Rawn's daughter, Grace.
</p>

<p>
Alas! for that young lady.  She unfortunately had
been now for almost a year an aspirant in her own
right to a seat upon the car of ease and luxury; yet
here she saw herself swiftly supplanted, and worse
than that, swiftly forgotten!  Her year of quasi-place
and power had left her unwilling to return to her own
humble home.  She remained on at Graystone Hall,
now rarely visited by her husband.  She found herself
calmly accepted, yet calmly neglected as well.  Very
naturally she hated the new Mrs. Rawn with all her
soul; a hatred which that lady repaid with nothing
better than a straight look into Grace's dark eyes, a
look innocent, calm, and wholly fearless.  Grace must
now see the very jewels her own mother should have
worn, blazing at the neck and hands of her stepmother;
must see that lady taking assuredly and as of right,
what Grace could now never ask or expect for herself.
With an unapproachable and wholly hateful air of
distinction and good breeding which rankled most of all
in crude Mrs. Halsey's heart, Virginia Rawn sat high
on the car of Juggernaut; and the car of Juggernaut
passed on.  In pride and delight over his young wife,
John Rawn really forgot his daughter.  The young
new wife did the same, or appeared to do so.
</p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
John Rawn had told the truth to his wife when first
he had declared his sentiments toward her&mdash;he never
before that time really had known love, or at least had
not known infatuated love such as that he felt for her.
He exulted in the vistas of delight which he saw before
them, fancying them endless.  The very sight of his
wife, cool, faultless, self-possessed, haughty, filled him
with a sense of his own importance, making him feel
that he was one of God's chosen.  She was his, he had
found her, discovered her, collected her.  She was his
to put upon a pedestal, to admire, to display, to
worship, to load down with jewels.  He had something
now which other men coveted and envied.  He flaunted
his ownership of such a woman in their faces.  What
more can a rich man do than that same?  Is that not
the dream and test of power&mdash;to secure what others
may not have, to secure special privileges in this life?
And is not the quest of beauty the first business of him
who has attained power?  Of all these special
privileges which had come to John Rawn so swiftly in
these late rapid years, none so delicately and warmly
filled his heart as that of being able to call Virginia
Rawn his own.  Why blame him?  The sultans of thirty
or forty generations have devised nothing better than
this test of power.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn, with all properly aristocratic leanings
toward sultanry, lacked certain elements of sultanhood
in strength, but had others in weakness.  He did not
know that in reality he was in the hands of a stronger
nature than his own.  "She's got him jumping through
hoops," was the comment of one young man.  "He'll
sit up and bark whenever she gives the word!"  But
Rawn did not know that he was barking and jumping,
his tongue hanging out excitedly.  In all his mental
pictures of himself he fancied himself to be a figure of
dignity, of strength, indeed of majesty.

CHAPTER II
<br />
FOUR BEING NO COMPANY
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Happy in his newly-found domestic delights,
Mr. Rawn was perhaps more careless than otherwise
he would have been regarding business affairs, and that
at a time when they needed care.  The truth was that
matters still lagged at the factory, as Rawn ought to
have known.  Indeed, he did know; but always his
curious helplessness in regard to Halsey&mdash;who alone
knew the last secrets of the most intricate devices of
the company's property&mdash;continued to oppress him.
And always here was his wife to console him and to
interest him.
</p>

<p>
The distance between Graystone Hall and the
factory apparently was becoming greater from month to
month.  Sometimes Halsey came to visit his wife, but
these visits of late became fewer and fewer, as that lady
became more and more discontented, less and less
eager to receive the attentions of him who had so
signally failed to place her where Virginia sat in power.
This alone left Halsey none too happy himself at the
prospect of any of his perfunctory calls; and moreover,
he found himself expected now to be more careful in
his attire, in his conduct about Graystone Hall, where
full evening dress tacitly was desired at dinner, and
where an aristocratic chill was habitual at any hour;
things not customary in Ann Sullivan's household on
the factory side of the city.  Not that Halsey needed to
excite social misgivings.  He was a clean-faced, manly
chap, lean, sinewy and strong, and might, save for his
rather toil-marked hands, have passed for any of the
throng of young men who at times came under one
pretense or other to visit Mr.&mdash;and Mrs.&mdash;Rawn.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
These, in company with Grace, he one evening found
alone, seated on the wide gallery that overlooked the
lake front.  He did notice then, as he never before at
any time had noticed, a singular truth&mdash;Virginia
Rawn's eyes seemed almost reluctant to leave him.  He
was half her husband's age.  Moreover, there was
something in the somber glow of his eye, in the occasional
look of his face&mdash;rapt, absorbed, remote, pondering on
things not made patent to all about him&mdash;which held
for her ever a stronger fascination.  She wondered if
things were known in his philosophy no longer
reckoned in her own; but which once might have been
germane to her as well.  She often looked at him.
</p>

<p>
The evening was clear and cool, the lake stirred with
no more than a gentle breeze.  The silver ladder of
the moon's light was flung down across the gently
moving waters.  The breath of flowers was all about.
Calm, ease, assuredness were here.  The voice of the
hostess was delightfully low and sweet.  All things
seemed in keeping.
</p>

<p>
Rawn welcomed his son-in-law with his customary
largeness of air.  "Come on out, Charles," said he,
"join us; the evening is pleasant.  Won't you have a
cigar?"  He fetched with his own hands the box of
weeds&mdash;"Take several, my boy, take as many as you
like.  I give two dollars apiece for these by the box at
my club, and you can't beat them in the city or
anywhere else."
</p>

<p>
Halsey listened almost absent-mindedly, and Rawn
returned to his seat near his wife, a little apart on the
gallery.  The master of Graystone Hall was intoxicated
more than usually this evening with her.  She
sat now in the dim light, a cool, dainty and beautiful
picture, in blue and ivory Duchesse satin and filmy
laces, gowned fit for a wedding or a ball, as she always
was of an evening at home, with just a gem gleaming
here and there in the occasional glimpse of light which
broke through the windows at the back of the gallery
as their curtains shifted in the breeze.  At that moment
John Rawn would have been glad to have the entire
world share boxes of cigars with him.  John Rawn,
collector&mdash;what man on all the North Shore Drive at
that moment could claim such surroundings as these?
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, Mr. Rawn," said Halsey, taking a
single cigar from the box which his host had placed
upon the near-by tabouret.  "I think I'll be content with
one.  I mustn't get into bad habits; I'm afraid Jim
Sullivan and I can't afford them at two dollars apiece
just yet!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
He moved now quietly and dutifully apart toward
the end of the gallery where sat a less resplendent
figure, that of his wife, Grace.  She had not risen to
meet him.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said he, as he sank into a seat beside her.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then?" she answered, and turned upon him a
face dour, inexpressive, pasty, almost frowning.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all you have to say to me?" she began later,
as he sat smoking.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't had much chance yet," he commented.
</p>

<p>
"No, I should say not!  This is the first time you've
been here for four weeks!  Have you stopped to think
of that?  You seem to care little enough how I get
on!"
</p>

<p>
Halsey paused for a moment before replying.  "That
hardly seems fair to me."
</p>

<p>
"Why isn't it fair?  It's the truth."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've been busy all the time, as you know.
Besides again, when it comes to that, it doesn't seem to
me that you've been altogether anxious to have me
come."
</p>

<p>
"You talk as though you worked day and night
and had nothing else to do."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose I could come over&mdash;every night
after dinner&mdash;wash the soot and the cinders from me,
get out my four-hundred-dollar go-cart, and come over
here to call on my wife in my thirty-dollar evening
togs, couldn't I?  She lives in Graystone Hall.  Where
do I live?  What do I get out of life, when it comes to
that, Grace?  When I do come here, you begin to
nag me before I get settled down.  I always used to
say when I was a young man, that if I ever found
myself married to a nagging woman, I'd just quit her!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by that?" she demanded imperiously.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Again Halsey was deliberate, although he half
sighed as he replied: "Pretty much what I say,
Mrs. Halsey, since you ask me.  The truth is, you quit me
when I needed you.  I have had worry enough from
this business at the factory.  I don't particularly care
to have all other kinds of worry on top of that.  You
had all this place to fall back on.  Your father's taken
care of you.  But he hasn't taken care of me very well.
The fact is, I've been scapegoat about long enough!"
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have learned the factory ways of talking!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I don't know but I am getting rather plain,
and common, and vulgar.  It's a little different
here&mdash;even from Kelly Row, let alone our place on the West
Side.  I fancy you're getting the North Shore accent,
along with other things.&mdash;It all only means that we're
that much further apart, Grace.  Did you ever stop to
think of that?"
</p>

<p>
"I've had time to think of plenty of things," she
answered bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"You had plenty of time to think of some of them
before you came over here," he rejoined.  "You didn't
like what your husband could offer you, and you chose
something better which your father did offer you.
You've quit me, practically.  You've not been in our
home twice since you came to live here.  I've seen that
poor baby of ours only once in a while since you left
our home for this.  You've not been a wife to me.
That's the truth about it&mdash;I might as well not be
married!  That comes mighty near being the situation,
since you put it up to me to answer."
</p>

<p>
"Then what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"The courts would make it a case of desertion, if
you force me to say that," answered Halsey.  "Now,
I don't want to live on this way for ever!  I'm a young
man, and my career's ahead of me!  I've got to choose
regarding my life before long!  And I'm going to
choose.  I'm not going to let things run on in this way
any further."
</p>

<p>
"That's what my father always said!  Your career;
your life!  Where does your wife come in?"
</p>

<p>
"You come in precisely where you say you want to
come in, Grace.  We get what we earn in this world.
If you leave me and take up a life which I can't share,
if you leave my house and don't care for what I can
give you&mdash;why there's not much left to talk about as to
where you come in.  You come in <i>here</i>.  I belong over
there."
</p>

<p>
"You're selfish!  All men are, I think."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to argue about that in the least,
Grace, except to say that it's the Rawn half of you that
said that.  The Rawn half of you can't see anything
but its own part of the world.  It wasn't the Rawn
half of you that I married.  You were different, then.
You're not much like your mother, Grace!  And I
married the part of you that was like your mother.  She
was a good woman, and a good wife."
</p>

<p>
"You must not speak of her!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I must, and I shall when I like.  It's all
in evidence.  There's the record."  He nodded toward
the two dim figures at the other end of the gallery.
"She's very beautiful, yes, very beautiful!"  His eyes
lingered on the figure of Virginia Rawn, faintly
outlined, cool in satin and laces.
</p>

<p>
"She'd like to hear you say that!" sneered his wife.
</p>

<p>
"I perceive, my dear, that you two love each other
very much.  But as I was saying, you don't seem to
me, Grace, to be much like your own mother&mdash;you're
more like your stepmother, over there, in some ways.
Your mother didn't change.  She made good&mdash;if you'll
let me use some more factory slang&mdash;on the old ways,
on her own old lines.  That's what I call class,
breeding, blood, if you like&mdash;just plain North American
sincerity and simplicity.  She didn't pretend, she didn't
try to climb where she knew she couldn't go.  That's
what <i>I</i> call blood!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you!  You're sincere also, at least."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
He seemed not to hear her.  He went on.  "But
you've changed.  You dropped me.  Your head was
turned with all this sort of thing....  Since these
things are true, are you coming back to me?"  He found
himself wrenching his eyes away from the cool dim
figure far down the long gallery.
</p>

<p>
She straightened up suddenly, pale.  "Back!&mdash;to
that?  To live in that hole&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, just back to <i>that</i>, Grace.  It's all I have to
offer you.  Just that hole."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not happy here."
</p>

<p>
"Then why do you stay here?  Why don't you come
back to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I couldn't be happy over there any more,
either!  I know it.  I admit it.  It's got me&mdash;I couldn't
go back to the old ways, the ways we'd have to live.
Why can't you come here&mdash;why doesn't Pa give us
money enough&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He turned to her now gravely.  "I suppose it's the
pace&mdash;yes, it's got you, and a lot of others.  But I'm
not taking that sort of money just yet.  And that
doesn't answer my question.  I've come over to-night
to arrive at some understanding about us two.  I
want to know where I am.  There are going to be
changes, one way or another."
</p>

<p>
She turned to him suddenly again.  "What's wrong
over at that factory, Charley?" she asked.  "Why
haven't you made good before this?  My father has
been on the point of tearing up things a dozen times!
He's sore at you&mdash;awfully sore."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?  How do you know I haven't made good?"
</p>

<p>
"Then why has Pa talked so?"
</p>

<p>
"For the very good reason that he doesn't know any
better than to talk that way.  He hasn't got any more
sense.  He didn't talk that way to me."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have got it&mdash;you've made the discovery&mdash;it'll
work?"
</p>

<p>
"Our machines not only will work, but have been
working," said he calmly.  "I haven't seen fit to tell
your father.  I'm going to tell you, however, that all
this was <i>my</i> idea from the first.  If I haven't been a
competent manager, let him get some one more competent.
I'll take what I know with me in my own head.
I'm saying to you, his daughter, that <i>I</i> worked out
this idea, myself, and all he did was to get the money
in the first place for it.  For that reason I call this
discovery mine, to do with as I like.  I haven't been
bought and paid for, myself.  I don't want money
when it costs too much.  I've just begun to understand
things lately."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I've worked it out into practical form," he
concluded, as she sat silent.  "Your father never did
and never can.  He's got to come to <i>me</i>, to <i>me</i>, right
here.  Since you drive me to it, I'll just tell you one
thing.  I've had this whole thing in my own hands
for more than eight months!  The company doesn't
know it, he doesn't know it, no one knows it.  I've
been just waiting&mdash;to see whether I had a wife or
not."
</p>

<p>
"You never told?  Then you've been disloyal, you've
been a coward!  You took his money&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Halsey suddenly, grimly, "that's
all I need.  I see, now.  I know what to do now."
</p>

<p>
"But you <i>didn't</i> tell father!" she went on fiercely.
"And we all knew how much has been depending on
that factory.  Weren't we all in that&mdash;didn't we all
help, from the very first?  Didn't I?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you did, you and your mother," said Halsey.
"You've had or will have all you earned.  She got
divorced from her husband, you may get divorced
from me!  It's a fine world, isn't it?  We've all been
chasing for more money.  Well, here we are!  There's
a couple over there, here's another one here.  Fine,
isn't it?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
"But, Charles!"  She moved toward him and laid
a hand on his arm.  "You don't stop to reflect on
what you are saying!  If you have that secret in your
hands, why, don't you see&mdash;don't you <i>see</i>&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, even Pa <i>will</i> have to come to you!  You
won't be poor then."
</p>

<p>
"I should say he <i>would</i> have to come to me!" said
Charles Halsey slowly.  "Yes, I dare say.  I dare say,
also, I could make a lot of money whether he did or
didn't."
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Charley.  He's got everything, and he
wants everything.  He's my father, but he doesn't care.
He&mdash;he sold me out.  What do we owe to him and
<i>her</i>?  What did he do to my mother?  I tell you, he
thinks of no one but <i>himself</i>.  Yet you and I&mdash;we
who found that idea and worked it out, who have it in
our own hands now, as you say&mdash;you and I have got
the whip in our own hands now, it seems to me."
</p>

<p>
"You talk excellent business sense, Mrs. Halsey.  I
compliment you.  It seems that you begin to discover
something in your husband and his possibilities.  It's
a trifle late, but you delight me!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't <i>know</i>, you see," she murmured, pawing
at him vaguely, in a fitful and inefficient essay at
some coquettish art, grotesque in these conditions.
</p>

<p>
She was a woman of small feminine charm at best.
She sat there now, angular, stiff, unbeautiful, the sort
of woman no clothes can make well-dressed.  Already
she had disclosed somewhat of her soul.  What appeal,
then, physical, emotional, moral, could she make to
him&mdash;a student, a visionary, an idealist&mdash;at such a
moment?  And did there not remain that same cool distant
figure from whom he had so constantly to wrench his
eyes&mdash;and his heart?  Yes; and his heart!  Halsey's
face was dull red.  He was unhappy.  The world
seemed to him only a hideous nightmare, full of
disappointments, injustices, of wrongs that cried aloud for
righting.  Ah, the comparison now was here, fair and
full and unavoidable!
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
"No, you didn't know," said he slowly.  "A lot of
people don't.  Now let me tell you a few things more.
You didn't know that something like a year ago your
father told me that he'd make me a present of
fifty-thousand dollars the day I could run a car from the
factory to this place on a charge taken from our own
overhead receiver-motors."
</p>

<p>
"A start for a million dollars!" she murmured.
"You get <i>that</i>&mdash;when you succeed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is to say, I could have had that any day
in the week these past eight months&mdash;if he really has
got that much left where he can realize on it.  He's
pretty well spread out."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have had it&mdash;what have you done with
the money?"
</p>

<p>
"I presume I look as though I'd spent or could
spend a mere fifty thousand dollars or so, don't I?"
was his quiet answer.  "No, I didn't have it, and I
haven't got it.  I'll say this much to you, however,
that I ran my little old car over here <i>to-night</i> on a
charge taken out of one of the overhead receiver-motors
of the International Power Company&mdash;a motor
completed on my own ideas, and by my own hands.
It's mine, I tell you&mdash;<i>mine</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Charley!"  She caught him by the wrists, with
both hands, eagerly.  "You can give me the things
I've got used to having!  I'll go back&mdash;oh!  I'll go
back&mdash;we'll go on together!  I hate her so&mdash;you don't
know!"
</p>

<p>
"That's nice of you, Grace; but you've guessed
wrong.  I've not got that fifty thousand yet."
</p>

<p>
"But you <i>can</i> have."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I can.  What could I buy with it?  For one
thing, I could buy back my wife?"
</p>

<p>
"But Charley!  We're rich!  You've succeeded!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I am poor, I've failed.  I'm just beginning to
see how <i>much</i> I've failed!"
</p>

<p>
"If you don't tell me the truth about this I'll do it
myself!" she exclaimed fiercely.  "You've not been
loyal&mdash;you've taken pay!"
</p>

<p>
"Your father took his pay from me," was his half-savage
answer.  "He's been paid enough!  As for me,
I don't want any more of this sort of pay."
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do&mdash;you're not going to
sell out to some one else?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear, I'm not going to do precisely what
you suggested I <i>should</i> do just a moment ago.  I'm not
going to sell out.  I could do that, too, and make more
than any fifty thousand.  The foreman in our
factory, who knows very little, can sell out to-morrow
morning for ten thousand dollars, maybe double or
treble that now.  The watchman on our door can sell
out when he likes.  We can all sell out, any of us sell
out.  But we haven't!  If there has been any selling
out it has been done by those who built this place
here&mdash;the place which you found better than the best home
I could offer you."
</p>

<p>
She sat back stiff, silent, somber.  "You&mdash;you never
mean that you are going to throw this away, then!"
she asked at length.  "What earthly good will that do?
Pa'll have it out of you somehow!  I'll&mdash;I'm going to
tell him!"
</p>

<p>
"Try it," said Charles Halsey easily.
</p>

<p>
She had courage.  "Father," she called out.  "Pa!
Come here&mdash;at once!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
Rawn rose suddenly up from his chair at the startling
quality in her voice.  "What's that, Grace?" he
called across the long gallery.
</p>

<p>
"Come here, I want you!  We've got something to
say to you."
</p>

<p>
Halsey sat motionless.
</p>

<p>
Rawn approached slowly, obviously annoyed.  "If
it's important&mdash;" he began.  He had found love-making
to his young wife especially delicious this evening,
although he mistook her strange silence and
preoccupation merely for wifely coyness.
</p>

<p>
"It is important!" Grace exclaimed; and rising,
clutched at his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, what's it all about, what's it about?
Come, come!"
</p>

<p>
"Charley's <i>done</i> it, he's <i>got</i> it&mdash;he's got the machines
<i>finished</i>&mdash;over there&mdash;!"  Her voice was almost a
scream, hoarse, croaking.  She stood bent, tense.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" demanded Rawn.  "What do you
mean?  Is that the truth, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"He came over in his own car, under International
overhead&mdash;he told me so, right now," she went on,
half hysterically.  "You owe him money&mdash;a lot, a pile
of money&mdash;he told me so right now&mdash;it's worth more
than any fifty thousand.  Oh, we're going to have
money too.  You see!"
</p>

<p>
Rawn shook off her arm and half flung her back in
her chair.  "What's this about, Halsey?" he said.  "Is
it true?"
</p>

<p>
Halsey nodded calmly, but said nothing.
</p>

<p>
Rawn half-assailed him, his large hand on his shoulder.
"<i>Did you get the current?</i>" he demanded.  "Did
you really come over under power out of one of our
overheads?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, to-night," said Halsey calmly.  "Often before."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IX
</p>

<p>
"Why, my boy, my boy!" began John Rawn.  At
once he stood back, large, complaisant, jubilant.  "My
boy!" was all he could say.  Not even his soul could at
once figure out in full acceptance all the future which
these quiet words implied.
</p>

<p>
"Come!" he explained after a moment, excitedly.
"Let's get to the telephone!  I want the wires right
away!  I'll make a million out of this before morning!"
</p>

<p>
"And write me a check for my fifty thousand
to-night?" smiled Halsey.
</p>

<p>
"Surely I will&mdash;I've told you I would&mdash;I'll do more
than that&mdash;I'll make it a twenty-five thousand extra
for good measure.  I'll have the check taken care of
to-morrow at my bank, as soon as I can get down-town!
Oh, things'll begin to <i>happen</i> now, I promise
you!"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't be in too big a hurry to use the wire,
Mr. Rawn," said Charles Halsey quietly.  "And never
mind about your check."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?  You're going to try to hold
me up?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not going to try to hold you up at all.  If
there's any question about that possibility, I can get
a million to-morrow as easily as I can any fraction of
a million to-night, Mr. Rawn, and it's just as well you
should know that, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"A million?" croaked John Rawn.  "You'd sell us out?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>No</i>, I said.  I'm not going to sell you out, Mr. Rawn.
And you're not going to buy me out."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, of course not," laughed Rawn
hoarsely.  "You didn't understand me."
</p>

<p>
"You haven't understood me either, Mr. Rawn.
Now, what would you do if I told you that after taking
my charge for the little car yonder I turned about
and dismantled every motor in the shop&mdash;destroyed
them all&mdash;locked up the secret, ended the whole game
now&mdash;to-night?  What would you say to that?"
</p>

<p>
"By God!  I'd kill you!" said John Rawn.

CHAPTER III
<br />
THE STEP-MOTHER-IN-LAW
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
On this very beautiful evening, in this very beautiful
scene&mdash;as beautiful as any to be found in all
that luxurious portion of a great city representing the
flower of a great country's civilization&mdash;Graystone
Hall was a double stage.  At the back of the tall
mansion house countless auto-cars passed in brilliant
procession, carrying countless men and women, personal
evidences of all the ease and luxury that wealth can
bring; and of these who passed, the most part looked
in with envy at the tall mansion house beyond the
curving lines of shrubbery, brilliantly illuminated now,
the picture of beauty and ease, of peace and content.
More than one soft-voiced woman murmured, "Beautiful!"
as she passed.  More than one man, more than
one woman, envied the owners of this palace.
</p>

<p>
"He's awfully gone on his wife, they say,"
commented one young matron, much as many did.  "Not
that I see much in her myself&mdash;although she seems to
have a sort of way about her, after all."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky beggar!" growled her husband.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they're both lucky."
</p>

<p>
That both Mr. and Mrs. Rawn were lucky seemed to
be the consensus of opinion of the procession of those
passing at this moment along the great driveway, and
hence looking upon the rear stage of the drama then
in progress.  But they saw no drama.  The evening
was beautiful.  The spot was one of great beauty.
Apparently all was peace and content.  There was no
drama visible, only a stage set for a scene of happiness.
Yet, two hundred yards from the point of this belief,
on the stage of the dimly-lighted gallery facing
the lake, the comedy of life and ambition, of success
and sorrow, moved on briskly; moved, indeed, to its
appointed and inevitable end.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Rawn's voice, harsh, half animal in its savagery,
wakened some sudden kindred savagery in young
Halsey's soul.  In a flash the spark rose between steel
and flint.  The accumulated resentment of many days
made tinder enough for Halsey now.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Mr. Rawn," said he, his head dropping,
his chin extended.  "Go on with the killing now, if
you like.  I'm going to tell you right here, that sort of
talk will do you no good.  If you kill me you kill my
secret.  It isn't yours, and neither you nor any other
man is apt to set it going again."
</p>

<p>
"You hound, you cur!" half sobbed Rawn.  His
daughter stood, tense, silent, unnoticed at his elbow.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you!  Now, I'll tell you.  I dismantled every
motor, and I'm never going to build them again for
you.  I meant every word of what I said.  Also I mean
this!"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he rose and struck Rawn full in the
face with his half-clenched hand.  The sound of the
blow could have been heard the whole length of the
gallery&mdash;was so heard.  An instant later, half roaring,
John Rawn closed with the younger man....
</p>

<p>
The women, plucking at their arms, could do nothing
to separate the two, indeed were not noticed in
the struggle.  As to that, the whole matter was over
in an instant.  Halsey was far the stronger of the two.
He caught the right wrist of Rawn as he smote down
clumsily, caught his other wrist in the next instant,
and then slowly, by sheer strength, forced him back
and down until at last he crowded him into the chair
which Grace a moment earlier had vacated.  The bony
fingers of his hand worked havoc on John Rawn's
wrist, on his twisted arm.  Halsey was not so long
from his college athletics, where he had been welcome
on several teams.  He was younger than Rawn, his
body was harder from hard work and abstemiousness.
He was the older man's master.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down!" he panted.  "I don't think you'll do this
killing very soon!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Rawn, for the first time in his life, faced a situation
which he could not dominate by arrogance and bluster.
For the first time in his life he had met another
man, body to body, in actual physical encounter; and
that man was his master!  All at once the consciousness
of this flashed through every fiber of him, bodily
and mental.  He had met a man stronger than
himself&mdash;yes, stronger both in body and in mind.  The
consciousness of that latter truth also sank deep into
his heart.  It was a moment of horror for him.  He,
John Rawn, master of this place, rich, happy,
prosperous&mdash;he, John Rawn, beaten&mdash;subdued&mdash;it could
not be!  Heaven never would permit that!
</p>

<p>
They all remained tense, silent, motionless, for just
half an instant; it seemed to them a long time.  Halsey
at length straightened and turned toward the door.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going," said he dully.  "Good by, Grace."
</p>

<p>
Rawn turned, confused, distracted.  He cared for no
more of the physical testing of this difference.  But he
saw Success passing in the reviled figure of his son-in-law.
"No, no!" he cried&mdash;"Jennie&mdash;he fouled me&mdash;but
don't let him go&mdash;he'll ruin us, do you hear?"
</p>

<p>
Halsey was within the tall glass doors and passing
toward the front entry.  He heard the rustle of skirts
back of him and felt a light hand upon his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he began; and turning, faced young Mrs. Rawn!
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," he stammered, "it's disgraceful.  I beg
your pardon with all my heart.  But I couldn't help it.
He struck me first with what he said.  He threatened
me.  Let me go.  I'll never come back here again.  I'm
sorry&mdash;on your account&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Charles," she said softly, "Charley, wait.  Where
are you going?"
</p>

<p>
"To the divorce courts, and then to hell."
</p>

<p>
"But you mustn't go away like this.  I'm sorry, too.
Wait!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly moved by some swift, irresistible impulse,
perhaps born of this unregulated scene where all seemly
control seemed set aside, she put both her white bare
arms about his neck and looked full into his eyes, her
own eyes bright.  He caught her white wrists in his
hands; but did not put away her arms.  He stood
looking at her, frowning, uncertain.  His blood flamed.
</p>

<p>
"It's disgrace," he said, "I admit it.  I can't square
it any way in the world.  I'm sorry on your account&mdash;awfully
sorry!"  His blood flamed, flamed.
</p>

<p>
"Listen!" she said, panting, eager, her voice with
some strange, new, compelling quality in it, foreign to
her as to himself.  "You mustn't go.  You mustn't
ruin the future of us all in just a minute of temper.
Yen mustn't ruin yourself, or&mdash;<i>me</i>.  Besides, there's
Grace!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Grace!"
</p>

<p>
"But she's your wife."
</p>

<p>
"Not any longer.  She's chosen for herself.  She left
me and would not come back.  I'm going now.  I'm
on my own from this time."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" she asked coolly.  "But why wreak
ruin on us all?  You don't stop to think!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it will set him back pretty badly&mdash;"  Halsey
nodded toward the bowed frame of Rawn, dimly visible,
in the gallery's shade, through the tall glass doors.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said slowly, "he's my husband, surely."
</p>

<p>
&mdash;"Who has given you everything."
</p>

<p>
She nodded, her arms still about his neck.  "Let me
think this out for all of us, Charley.  Keep matters as
they are until I have time to think&mdash;won't you do that
much&mdash;just that little&mdash;for me?"
</p>

<p>
His hands were still upon her wrists as he looked
down upon her from his height, his eyes angry, his
face frowning, disturbed.  Worn almost to gauntness,
tall, sinewy, of a certain distinction in look, as he
stood there before her now an ignorant observer might
have thought the two lovers, he her lover, not her
stepson, she at the least his younger sister, surely not
his mother by mixed marriage.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
As they stood thus, Rawn turning, saw them through
the tall glass door.  His face grew eager.  "He's <i>not</i>
gone," he whispered hoarsely to his daughter, who
stood rigid, close at his arm.  "She's got him!  By
Jove!  She's a wonder&mdash;my wife, my wife&mdash;she'll land
him yet&mdash;she will!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you see that?" hissed Grace at last, pointing at
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Do I see it&mdash;didn't you hear me?  Yes, of course I
see it!"
</p>

<p>
"And you'll allow <i>that</i>, between your wife and my
husband?"
</p>

<p>
"Allow it&mdash;wife!&mdash;why! damn you, girl, what are
you <i>talking</i> about&mdash;wives and husbands?&mdash;what's that
to do with this?  There's many a million dollars up
now, I tell you, on those two standing there.  You make
a move now&mdash;say a word&mdash;and I'll wring your neck,
do you hear?"  He caught her by the wrist.  She sank
into a chair, sobbing bleakly.
</p>

<p>
A moment later the two figures beyond the door
stood a trifle apart.  The arms of Virginia Rawn
dropped from Halsey's neck.  She laid a hand upon his
arm and, side by side, neither looking out toward the
gallery, they drew deeper into the room, behind the
shelter of a heavy silken curtain which shut off the
view.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful night.  The long ladder of the
moon still lay across the gently rippling lake, which
murmured at the foot of Graystone Hall's retaining
sea-wall.  The scent of flowers was about.  It was a
scene of peace and beauty and content.  John Rawn
and his daughter remained upon the gallery for a time.

</p>

<p>
"Charles," said Virginia Rawn, "Charley&mdash;"  And
always her white hand touched his shoulder,
his arm, his hand&mdash;"You really mustn't go.  Believe
me, you'll both be sorry to-morrow.  You don't
know what you're doing!  You're only angry now.
You'll both be sorry."  Her eyes glowed, evaded.
</p>

<p>
Halsey shook his head.  "It's all over, so far as I'm
concerned."  His eyes, glowing, sought hers.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Charley, boy, that's all foolishness.  Don't
you know how wrong it is to talk in that way?  What
hasn't Mr. Rawn done for you?  And she's your wife!"
</p>

<p>
"He has done little for me and much for himself," he
answered hotly.  "As for her, his daughter, she left
me for him and what he could give her.  She liked this
sort of thing rather better than what I could do for
her.  She weighed it up, one side against the other,
and she chose this.  Most women would, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Charley, how you talk!"  Her voice, reproving,
none the less was very gentle, very soft.  "One would
think you were a regular misanthrope.  The next thing,
you'll be saying that I was that sort of a woman
because <i>I</i> live here.  Of course, other things being equal,
any woman likes comfort.  But you seem to think that
we all would choose luxury to love."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Don't</i> you&mdash;don't you all?" demanded the unhappy
youth.  "Some do, of course.  Would you?  Haven't
you?"  He was reckless, brutal, now.  The young
woman before him started, shivered.  She passed a
hand gropingly across her bosom, across her brow.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
There was a strained, very strong quality in the
air of Graystone Hall that evening.  Thought seemed
to leap to thought, mind to mind, swiftly, without
trouble for many words.  These two at last looked at each
other face to face, deliberately, she gazing beneath
heavy, half-closed lids, a superb, a beautiful woman,
a creature for any man's admiration.  He was a manly
young chap.  He stood a victor, as she had seen but
now.  He gazed at her out of eyes open and direct.
Reckless, brutal in his despair, he now allowed&mdash;for the
first time in all their many meetings&mdash;his heart to show
through his eyes.  For the first time, their eyes met full.
</p>

<p>
"You must not ask that," said she quickly.  "I
wouldn't want to tell you anything but the truth
about it."  She was breathing faster now.
</p>

<p>
"What is the truth about it?  I want to know if any
woman is worth while.  I'm down and out myself, and
it doesn't matter for me.  I just wondered."
</p>

<p>
"I used to see you often about the office," said she
irrelevantly, "when you came in to see Mr. Rawn.  I
rather thought Grace was lucky, then!  I was just a
girl then, you know, Charley."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Mrs. Rawn?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  What did you think I meant?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know.  I've never dared think much.  I
supposed everything was going to come out right
somehow.  Now it's come out wrong.  I don't know
just where it began.  Don't you see, Mrs. Rawn, it's
all like a faulty conclusion in logic?  It builds up fine
for a long time.  Then all at once things go wrong&mdash;it's
absurd, and you wonder why.  Well, it's because
there's what you call a faulty premise somewhere down
close to the start.  If that's the case, there isn't anything
in all the world is ever going to make a conclusion
come out right.  I reckon there's a wrong premise
somewhere down in my life, or ours, or in this!"&mdash;He
swept an arm, indicating Mr. Rawn's opulent
surroundings.
</p>

<p>
"I'm only a woman, Charley.  Maybe I don't understand you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll tell you.  There's wealth, luxury,
everything here.  Where did they get it?  They took more
than their share."
</p>

<p>
"Now you're talking like a Socialist.  Mr. Rawn
tells me you are a Socialist, Charley."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe I am.  But I believe a good many
would be if they'd gone through what I have.  Now,
what those two took, they took from me&mdash;what you've
got here you got from me.  I don't mind that.  The
big trouble is&mdash;the wrong premise about it is&mdash;that
what they took they took from this people, this
country.  And there are so many who even are hungry."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we'd never get done if we began that way!
All success does that way, you know that.  Not all
can be rich."  Her eyes still came about to him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all success succeeds&mdash;until that wrong premise
comes out.  Then there's trouble!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to sell us out, Charley?" she
demanded suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"I never sold out anybody.  I'm the one that's been
sold out."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't we your real friends?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  You ought to be, but you aren't.  The only
friends I've got are over there in the factory&mdash;Jim and
Ann Sullivan, Tim Carney&mdash;a few of the working-men
that stuck it through.  They've killed five men for us
over there.  Their sluggers are out all the time.  As for
me, I don't fit in, either there or here.  Look here,
Mrs. Rawn," he went on, turning upon her suddenly and
placing his hand impulsively on hers.  "Let me tell
you something.  I haven't sold out&mdash;I'm not going to.
Where do you stand yourself?"
</p>

<p>
Her eyelids fluttered.  "Charley," said she, "you
know better than to ask me that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose I do," he answered slowly and
bitterly.  "You stand for this place, for everything that
money can buy.  Have they made you happy?  I often
wonder&mdash;does money really make people happy?  Are
you happy?"  His eyes were very somber, very direct.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if I am," said she suddenly; "and I wonder
how you dare ask me.  Oh, I'll admit to you I've
been ambitious, and always will be.  But do you know,
some time I'd like to talk with your friend&mdash;with Ann
Sullivan!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Then</i> you'd begin to get at life.  You'd be getting
down to premises, then, that aren't wrong&mdash;with Ann
Sullivan and her sort!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, I reckon you'd only find a little sincerity
and honesty, and, well&mdash;maybe&mdash;love, that's all.  Just
the things I didn't get myself.  Have you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you?"  She ignored his brutal query.
</p>

<p>
"Because I'm a theorist.  Because I'm a visionary
and a fool, I reckon.  Because I like to see fair play
even in a dog fight, and the people of this country
aren't getting fair play.  Because I'm the sort of fool
that Mr. Rawn isn't.  There's the difference!
</p>

<p>
"Are you happy, Mrs. Rawn?" again he demanded
suddenly, since she still was silent.  "Tell me the truth.
I think you know I'm not going to talk.  I'm going
away somewhere&mdash;anyhow for the summer.  I suppose,
maybe, this is the last time I'll ever see you&mdash;in all my
life."
</p>

<p>
She felt the candor of his speech and replied in like
kind, smiling slowly.  "No use my lying," she said.
"You know I'm not happy.  And, yes, I know you'll
not talk.  Who <i>is</i> happy?  We all just get on just the
best we can.  I can take my joy in making other women
envy me.  Isn't that about what all women want?  Isn't
that the height and limit of their ambition?  Isn't that
success, so far as a woman is concerned?  Don't they
cling to it, all of them&mdash;till they get old?  I suppose so,
but I know it isn't happiness.  Yes, I'll admit to you I
do miss something."  His eyes rested upon her,
searching.
</p>

<p>
Unconsciously she looked down at her wrists.  The
red mark of his fingers still lingered there.  "I'll have
to ask Ann Sullivan some time," she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"One thing," answered Halsey.  "She'd tell you that
she isn't trying to get the envy of her neighbors.  I
don't believe she'd be happy in that!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but she's fresh over&mdash;she's not American yet,
don't you see?  She hasn't had a chance&mdash;you can't
tell what she would do if she were rich."

<p>
"There are two ways of looking at it," said Halsey
musingly, his anger passing, now leaving him meditative,
relaxed.  They were talking now as though there
were not two others, unhappy, waiting on the gallery
near by.  "I'll tell you something, if you'll let me talk
about myself, Mrs. Rawn."
</p>

<p>
"Go on; I'm glad!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose you care for things that interest
me.  You called me a Socialist.  I'll admit that I
studied a lot about that, attended their meetings, all
that sort of thing.  Maybe that made me think.  It
seems to me that money is rolling up too fast in this
country now&mdash;we're all mad about money.  It's like
the big apple with no taste to it.  I had it offered me to
choose between those two, and I took the little apple
that to me seemed sweeter.
</p>

<p>
"Now, I've perfected that invention.  It'll make
somebody rich any time I say the word&mdash;any time I
like that big apple and not the little one&mdash;any time I
like that success which comes from outside and not
from inside.  But I've figured that that doesn't mean
happiness.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I don't know.  Somehow
I believe that Abraham Lincoln, or John Ruskin,
or Jim Sullivan, or Tim, or Ann, or Sir Isaac
Newton&mdash;any thinking person&mdash;any philosopher&mdash;would come
in with me about this.  I broke up the machines."
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;where it meant ruin?"
</p>

<p>
"Because they'd tighten up the grip of a few men on
the neck of the people!  I don't know whether you call
that being a Socialist or not, and I don't care.  Change
is coming.  It's not the fault of the poor that it's coming.
It's the fault of the rich.  I broke them up&mdash;because
things can't go on this way, money rolling Up all the
time for a few, and life getting harder all the time for
so many.  God didn't make the rivers and the mountains
and the forests for that purpose&mdash;to give them
to a few.  We've got to make changes, and big ones, in
this government, or we're gone.  I'm no Socialist at all.
I don't want what some one else has won&mdash;if he's won
it <i>fair</i>.  But the wrong is in our government&mdash;the very
one of all on earth that meant fair play.  We don't get
it&mdash;now.  Some day we must.  I don't see what
difference it makes what name you give the new form of
government.  There must be <i>change</i>, that's all; or else
we're gone!
</p>

<p>
"Well now, what they wanted me to do was to give
that all to a few.  I couldn't do it!  By God!
Mrs. Rawn, I faced it and I tried, and I <i>couldn't</i> do it!
Maybe I was wrong.  Anyhow, here I stand."

"Do you know," she said at length, slowly, "these
are things that never came to my mind in all my life?
I never in all my life thought of any of these things.
I only wanted&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You wanted to win.  You wanted what most
American women do&mdash;money&mdash;station&mdash;power&mdash;to be
envied; that's what you played for.  Well, you've
won!  Look at all this about you.  I don't suppose
there's a woman in this town more admired by men or
more envied by women than you.  You've got what
you craved, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
"I thought I had.  But now, to-night, I'm not so
sure!"
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't give it up," he sneered, "any more
than Grace could, and she couldn't any more than a
leopard could change its spots.  It goes too deep.
You couldn't expect anything different.
</p>

<p>
"I told you I was a student, Mrs. Rawn," he went
on after a time.  "I haven't got much mind.  But
somehow, while I don't suppose religion can change
business very much, I think of those twelve disciples and
their Master, trying to lift the load off of human
beings, trying to lift the people of the world up above
the day of tooth and claw.  I don't reckon they can do
it.  But you see, each fellow has to choose for himself.
I've had this put before me.  I could have thrown
in with Rawn&mdash;-I can do so yet, right here, now, as
you know.  I can hold him up, as he would hold me
up, or any one else&mdash;I can take his money&mdash;fifty-thousand,
a million&mdash;I don't think he's really got as
much money as most people think.  He's in debt, deep.
That's all right so long as your credit is good.  He has
had all sorts of credit&mdash;and it depended on <i>me</i>&mdash;on my
invention.  It wasn't his.  It isn't going to be.  I've
told you why.&mdash;But you see, I could make him divide
even with me&mdash;make him take a third, a fourth, of
what I'd won.  He'd have to come to terms.  He
knows that.  All right, I'm not going to do it!
Failure as I am, I've got a few ideas which I think are
right.  Maybe I got them from Ann Sullivan&mdash;I don't
know!  Go ask her about things."
</p>

<p>
"And you won't put back the machines?  Not even
for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Not even for you," he smiled.  "Not that I know
what you mean by that."  He looked at her keenly.  His
toil-stained hands twitched uneasily in his lap.
</p>

</p>

<p>
"You're talking about things that never came into
my thoughts in all my life," said she, with the same
strange deliberation, the same strange direct look at
him.  "But you couldn't expect an ignorant woman to
learn it all in one night, could you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not trying to convert you, Mrs. Rawn.  I'm
going to leave this place.  You'll not see me again.
But I'm not trying to change <i>you</i>.  I wouldn't&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Listen!" she broke out sharply.  "I'm set to do
that for you&mdash;I'm expected by him, out there, to
change you.  Isn't that the truth?  Didn't you see?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's easy to see," he answered grimly.  "It's
up to you."
</p>

<p>
"It's up to you and me, Charley, yes.  You can
ruin me and all of us by walking out that door.  You
can break the lives of those two people out there, and
mine, yes, of course you can, and your own.&mdash;You can
do all that.  You can make me come down from this
place where you say everybody envies me, and you can
have everybody laughing at me and forgetting me in
less than six months' time.  You can get me snubbed,
if you like; you can make me wretched and miserable,
if you like.  Of course you can.  Do you want to
do that?"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't fair to put it before me in that way."
</p>

<p>
"I do put it before you in that way.  But that isn't
the worst of what you could do&mdash;you'd leave me
unsettled and unhappy for ever if you went away to-night
that way&mdash;Charley!&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What can you mean&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Things are moving fast to-night, Charley, and
we're discussing matters pretty openly&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he nodded.  "I don't want to set a wife
against her husband.  Neither must you.  But the
truth is, Mr. Rawn is not what a good many think he
is&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
"Do you think that's news to me?" she asked of him,
and looked full into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Good God, Mrs. Rawn!  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Much what you do!"
</p>

<p>
"But you loved him&mdash;you married him!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, surely.  That was some months ago.  But
you see, there's a distinction between master and
superior."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very miserable," was his simple answer.
"Things are getting too much confused for me.  And
now you say you'd never be happy if I left you now,
to-night&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then why go, so long as we are so confused?
Why don't you wait?  I've asked you to!  Do you
expect to settle all this in a half-hour's time, in a
passion of anger?  Now listen.  Although he's my
husband, and she's your wife, I don't blame you.  I'm
only asking you to wait a little.  I'm making it
personal, Charley!"
</p>

<p>
"How dare you do that, Mrs. Rawn?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I have the right to do it!  I don't intend
to have you make me more unhappy than I am.  I've
just told you I'm not happy.  I don't know&mdash;" she
laughed a little amused ripple of laughter&mdash;"but I'd
have been happier if he had handled you as you did
him!  I'm not talking just the way I meant to when
I came through those doors to stop you.  I'm like
you&mdash;it's all confusing&mdash;<i>I'll</i> have to wait, the same as
you.  There's a lot of things to be figured out!  I'm
covetous of <i>everything</i> in the world&mdash;that <i>any</i> woman
ever had&mdash;from the Queen of England to Ann Sullivan!
Yes, I'm ambitious, I'll admit that.  And you've
set me thinking&mdash;I'm wondering&mdash;wondering what
really <i>is</i> the best a woman can get out of life."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Rawn, you've got success as you understand
it, by marrying a middle-aged man.  You're young."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "It isn't possible," said she
frankly, catching his thought.  "I'm far enough along
to see that!"
</p>

<p>
"You know what Mr. Rawn did when <i>he</i> wished
to change&mdash;he put away what he had, and reached out
for that which he had not.  For my own part, I don't
see how any woman could be happy with him.  He
ruined the life of one woman, his wife; of another, his
daughter.  Now, you tell me he hasn't made an
absolutely happy life for yet another woman&mdash;yourself.
Oh, it's brutal for me to say it, but it's true, and you've
just said it's true."
</p>

<p>
"If only it could come to the question of what a
woman really wanted&mdash;" she resumed, pondering.
</p>

<p>
"That's for each woman to figure out for herself,
Mrs. Rawn.  I've only said what most American
women want.  We're living in a wholesome and
beautiful age, Mrs. Rawn!"
</p>

<p>
"I thought I was right!" said she suddenly, looking
up.  "Now I believe I was wrong.  Charley!&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
"It's in the air," she said, as though to herself, after
a time, finding him silent, troubled, pale.  "Don't you
know, Charley&mdash;"  She turned to him.
</p>

<p>
He leaned toward her now, his lined young face
illuminated with sudden emotion.  "I wish I could
explain that to you, Mrs. Rawn," said he.  "I feel it,
too!  Now maybe we <i>can</i> understand!  How did I
drive my car over here, charged from one of our
overhead motors?  Ah, that's my secret.  But I took it
out of the air!  That motor of ours was in <i>tune</i> with
it&mdash;the great power that's in the air, everywhere.
Mrs. Rawn, it's getting in <i>tune with the world</i> that
makes you happy.  Nothing else is going to do it!
Get in tune with the <i>plan</i>!  All I've ever done in my
receiving-motor has been to get in tune with the hills
and the rivers and the forests&mdash;with <i>life</i>."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IX
</p>

<p>
She leaned toward him now, that on her face which
he had never seen there before.  He looked her fair
in the eyes and went on, firmly, strongly.
</p>

<p>
"I've done that; and I've said to myself that I
wasn't going to throw that away and give it to a few,
when it belonged to everybody.  I am unhappy as you
are; more so.  <i>I'm</i> not in tune with life as we live it.
No, I certainly am not.  But I know that to be perfectly
happy we've got to get in tune with the purpose
of the world.  What is it?  What <i>is</i> that second
current?  I don't know.  What is it?  You tell me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what I believe," said Virginia Rawn
slowly, her hands dropping in her lap, her face pale.
"I shouldn't wonder if it was&mdash;love!"
</p>

<p>
"And <i>that</i> belongs to everybody, not just a few&mdash;to
every one&mdash;not just to the rich men, with money
to buy what they want?"  He was looking at her keenly
now.
</p>

<p>
"To everybody?" She shook her head.  "Not
always, Charley."
</p>

<p>
"Why not&mdash;Virginia?"

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
"Well, he's gone, then?"
</p>

<p>
Rawn turned toward his wife a face years
older than it had been an hour ago, a face haggard and
lined, pasty in color.  His bitter agitation was evident
in his voice, in his expression, in the stoop of his
shoulders&mdash;in a score of signs not usual with him.
Virginia was even more noncommittal than her wont
as she faced him.  Grace had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"What did you do&mdash;how did you handle him, Jennie?"
he began&mdash;"you were talking for over an hour
there!  Did you manage to hold things together&mdash;will
he let up?"
</p>

<p>
She faced him full now, as he stood in the blaze of
the electric lights in the interior of the house, where
Halsey had left her, in the chair from which she had
not moved since his departure.  Every delicate, clear-cut
feature was fully visible now.  Her lips just parted
to show the double row of her white teeth in a faint
smile.  Her chin was a trifle up, her head high.
</p>

<p>
"He will wait a little while," she answered quietly.
"At least, I think so."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Fine!  I knew you'd do it, Jennie!  You're
a wonder!&mdash;I don't think there's a woman in all the
world like you!"  He advanced toward her.
</p>

<p>
"Don't paw me over!" she exclaimed, drawing back.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now, then&mdash;I only meant&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to talk," she said.  "He's gone, yes,
and he'll not do anything for a little while, I think.
It's enough for to-night&mdash;I'm tired.  This has been a
horrible evening for me.  I never thought to see a time
like this!"
</p>

<p>
"Horrible for all of us!" exclaimed John Rawn.
"That man took advantage of me out there&mdash;I ought
to have wrung his neck for him, and I would have
done it if it hadn't been for you two women.  Of
course, we don't want scenes if they can be avoided,
for there's no telling what talk might run into if it
got out.  But just the same, Jennie, don't you see&mdash;"
and his face assumed a still more anxious look&mdash;"he
can ruin us all whenever he gets ready, and he's wise
enough to know that.  I can't do anything with him
now.  Something's gone wrong with him, and I don't
know what!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
"No, you don't know what," she said slowly.  "I
don't think you in the least imagine what!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you, then?" he demanded.  "If you do, why
don't you tell?  Do you know that everything we've
got in the world is up at stake on this?  He can kill
my credit, he can split this company wide open, he
can break me in spite of all.  See what he's done in
return for what I've done for him!  Sometimes I
wonder if there's such a thing as honor left in the
world!"
</p>

<p>
"So!  Do you?"  She rose now, and would have
left him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I want to talk this over with you.  Please,
Jennie.  Sit down," he said.  "Tell me what you said.
I want to know where things are, so I can act
to-morrow&mdash;or maybe even before to-morrow.  You don't
realize what a hole I'm in."
</p>

<p>
"What did I say to him?" she repeated, looking
down at her wrists.  "Nothing very much.  I told him
if he went on he'd ruin us all; that it wasn't right for
him to do it.  I told him we wanted him&mdash;I wanted
him&mdash;to wait&mdash;for my sake."
</p>

<p>
"For your sake?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did," she answered calmly.  "I said that."
</p>

<p>
"It was best!" he cried, rising and walking up and
down excitedly.  "What a mind you have, Jennie&mdash;what
a woman you are!  Where'd I be without you, I
wonder now?  Why, of course, that was the way!
Any man will do anything that <i>you</i> tell him to,
especially a young man&mdash;of course, of course!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she commented coldly; "thank you
very much."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
He sought to put a consoling or an explanatory
hand on her shoulder, but she shook him off, shivering.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean anything," he began confusedly.
"Get me straight, now.  I only wanted to say that
when you work for me in this you are working for
your own sake also.  It's all up to you, Jennie, right
now.  If you can't land him, we're gone&mdash;it's no use
my trying to do anything with him.  Do you know,
I'm <i>going to send you out after him</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Send me out?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; things have to be done the best way they can
be done.  That fellow can say one word which'll ruin
us in one day's time.  He can break the values in
International more than we can mend in months.
Our men would begin to cover as soon as they caught
a hint that anything was really wrong.  As for me,
I'm spread out for millions in the general market.
If they began to hammer me I couldn't come through&mdash;I
wouldn't last a week.  The thing to do is to keep
this news safe until I can protect myself&mdash;until I can
protect us all.  Now it's you, Jennie, that's got to do
that&mdash;it's you!  I'm sending you out after him."
</p>

<p>
"I always thought, Mr. Rawn," said she, "that you
played a dangerous game, so long as you simply
trusted that he'd do anything you told him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I see it now.  But he always was odd&mdash;he
always held something back.  I tell you, he's crazy!
Now, he's either just crazy over his fool Socialist
ideas, or else he's going to hold out for a squeeze.  In
the first case you can handle him.  In the second, I
can.
</p>

<p>
"You see&mdash;I couldn't tell our directorate," he went
on; "but there was always something lacking which I
couldn't handle myself.  <i>We</i> need him, and we've got
to have him!  You can get him, I know you can.  You
can do anything you like.  You're wonderful!"
</p>

<p>
She sat and looked at him, her lips still parted in
the same enigmatic smile which he did not like to see;
but she made no answer.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong with him?" he went on immediately.
"What does he <i>say</i> is the trouble, anyway?  And is it
the truth that he's got the overhead current?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "Of course, I know something about it
from my work in the office.  Yes, he told me that he
had done what you have all been trying to do so long.
He said he came over under power from the
overhead&mdash;just as he told you."
</p>

<p>
"He may be lying, for all we know.  You can't look
at a car and tell where its charge came from.  Electricity
is electricity, to all intents and purposes.  What
I want to know is, what he's got against us, anyhow,
Jennie?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, for one thing, he seemed troubled because
Grace would not go back with him.  He seemed to
think that you and the life you could give her had been
the reason for her abandoning him."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what nonsense!  Grace hasn't abandoned
him!  And I only got her over here because I needed
her myself&mdash;before&mdash;well, before we were married.
Who was to take care of <i>me</i>, I'd like to know?  And
you say he complains of <i>that</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"That was one of the things."
</p>

<p>
"But Grace would go back!  She's none too well
pleased now, since you and I have taken charge
here.  She'd go back to Charley to-morrow if he asked
her&mdash;why, I'd <i>make</i> him take care of her, of course.
The trouble with him is, he values his own personal
affairs too much.  That's no way to begin in the
business world.  A man has to bend everything to the one
purpose of <i>success</i>.  Look at me, for instance."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
She did look at him, calmly, coldly, without the
tremor of an eyelid, without raising a hand to touch
him as he stood close by, without indeed making any
verbal answer.  A slight shudder passed over her,
visible in the twitch of her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"It's getting cooler!" he exclaimed.  "I'll fetch a
wrap for you."  And so hastened away, obsequious,
uxorious, as he always was with her.
</p>

<p>
"But Charley never would take any counsel from
anybody," resumed he presently.  "He's always been
tractable enough, that's true; never raised much of a
disturbance until to-night&mdash;I don't see why he cut up
so ugly now.  He's not crazy over Grace, and if the
truth be told, Grace isn't the sort of girl that a man
<i>would</i> get crazy over.  You're that sort."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not," she smiled faintly.  "Just the same,
Grace's attitude may have started him to thinking.
When he began thinking he seemed to conclude that all
the world was wrong."
</p>

<p>
"And he's starting in to set it right!  He's going
in for the uplift stunt, eh?  That's the way with a lot
of these reformers!  They want to set the world right
according to their own ideas.  They don't pay any
attention to the men who keep them from starving.  I
<i>made</i> that boy&mdash;what he's got he owes to me."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!  How singular!  He says that it's just the
other way about; that what you have you took from
him!  He says you want to take more&mdash;more than your
share&mdash;from things that belong to everybody."
</p>

<p>
"What's that!  What's that!  Well, now, of all the
insane idiocy I ever heard!  Good God, what next!
Him, Charles Halsey, the man I brought up with me!
Jennie, I never heard the like of that in all my time."
</p>

<p>
"But if that's the way he feels, now's not the time to
argue that with him!"
</p>

<p>
"But, good God, the effrontery&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All the world is full of effrontery, Mr. Rawn," she
said&mdash;continuing to address him formally, as she
always did.  "It's buy and sell.  Everything we get we
pay for in one way or another.  Even if we took power
out of the air by our overhead motors, we'd pay for
that, one way or another&mdash;nothing comes from
nothing&mdash;we pay, we pay all the time, Mr. Rawn!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>You</i> don't need to go into theories and generalizations,"
said he testily.  "We've had enough of that
from him.  We are both practical.  You simply get that
man and bring him back into the fold, that's all!  Do
your share."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
"My share?  It's easy, isn't it?"  She smiled at him
again annoyingly.
</p>

<p>
"But you can do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I can do it.  But I can't evade the truth I just
told you.  I'd have to pay.  You'd have to pay."
</p>

<p>
"We're beggars, and can't choose," said John Rawn
savagely.  "Besides, there's no harm done&mdash;I'm not
asking you to do anything improper, anything to
compromise yourself&mdash;but <i>get</i> him, that's all!  And when
we've got him in hand&mdash;when I know what I want to
know&mdash;I'll wring him dry and throw him on the scrap
heap.  That's what I'll do with him!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think you would," she said.
</p>

<p>
"It's the only right thing to do," Rawn fumed.  "He'll
get what's coming to him.  He's been throwing down
his one best friend."
</p>

<p>
"Are there any best friends in business, Mr. Rawn?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Of course there are.  Haven't I been a friend to
him; haven't I got a lot of friends of my own?"
</p>

<p>
"What would they do for you to-morrow, Mr. Rawn?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's a different matter; they might take
care of themselves&mdash;I would take care of myself.  But
this fool here that I'm asking you to handle isn't
taking care of himself or any one else.  He's crazy, that's
all about him!  Did he hand you out any of this talk
about the rights of man?  I more than half suspect
him of sympathizing with these labor unions.  He's a
Socialist at heart, that's what he is!"
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head a little.  "Names don't make
much difference in such matters."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
"Isn't it a funny thing," he rejoined, turning to her
in his walk, "that the very men who have failed, the
very ones who most need help themselves, are the ones
who are out to help everybody else!  The blind always
want to lead the blind!  These labor unions depend on
us for their daily bread and butter, yet they want to
fight us all the time.  There's no trust in this country
so big as the labor trust, and there's no ingratitude in
the world like that of the laboring man's.
</p>

<p>
"Why, look at me, Jennie&mdash;you know something of
my plans.  This very month I was going to put fifty
thousand dollars more into my cooperative farm in
the South, a thing I have been working out for the
benefit of my laboring people.  I'm going to do more
than old Carnegie has done!  You and I ought to have
set up some kind of prizes, medals&mdash;start some sort
of hero competition.  Helping colleges is old, and so
are libraries old.  I don't place myself any station
back of Rockefeller himself.  The Rockefeller Foundation
was a great idea.  Just wait!  I'll raise him out
of the game!  When I get all my plans made, they'll
speak of John <i>Rawn</i> when they mention philanthropy!
</p>

<p>
"And just to think, Jennie," he went on excitedly,
"that all such big plans as that, plans for the good of
humanity, should come to nothing!  To be held up and
handicapped by the folly of a man who has never been
able to do anything for himself or any one else!  It
makes me sick to think of it.  He claims to be a friend
of the laboring people, and here he's tying the hands
of the greatest friend of the laboring men in this town
to-day&mdash;myself, <i>John Rawn</i>, standing here!  Why, if
I'd hand this country the John Rawn Foundation for
industrial assistance, all thought out, all financed, all
ready to go to work to-morrow, that crazy fool there,
with his Socialist ideas, would block it all.  He's <i>going</i>
to block it all.
</p>

<p>
"Now, it's up to you.  You're the only one that can
keep him from doing that very thing.  Don't you see,
it isn't just you and me he's ruining.  It isn't himself
he's ruining.  He's going to hurt the whole <i>country</i>.
Jennie, there's a considerable responsibility on you
to-night.  Where he is wrong is in thinking that the weak
can help the weak.  It's the other way about&mdash;it's the
strong that can help&mdash;Power!&mdash;that's what counts!
It's for you to show him that.  Jennie, girl&mdash;it's not so
much myself.  But think of your country."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she nodded, "that's precisely it!"
</p>

<p>
"But he didn't affect you in the least, Jennie&mdash;he
didn't get <i>you</i> going with that kind of foolishness."
</p>

<p>
"I never heard any one talk just as he did, before,"
said she slowly.  "You see, I hadn't thought of these
things myself, for I'm only a woman.  He said that
all this power, taken from the hills and the forests and
the air and the rivers, belongs to <i>everybody</i>&mdash;to all
the world&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But he didn't impress <i>you</i> with that nonsense,
Jennie?"
</p>

<p>
"He said things&mdash;I told him that I'd never thought
of life just that way.  And I haven't, Mr. Rawn.  I
told him, as I admit to you, that I hadn't thought of
anybody much but myself&mdash;I just tried to climb.  I
think all women do."
</p>

<p>
"It's right they should, it's the only way.  Selfishness
is the one great cause of the world's progress, my
dear."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I told him that his way of thinking was so
new to me, that I needed time to think it over."
</p>

<p>
"But you didn't believe a word he said&mdash;you never
would!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rawn," said she, looking him full in the face,
"we've both of us climbed pretty fast.  I always put
my family out of memory all I could.  But somehow
I seem to recollect that my father used to talk of
things a good deal as Mr. Halsey does.  I begin to
realize what I told you a while ago&mdash;no matter how
or where we climb, we pay for what we get, sometime,
somewhere, somehow!
</p>

<p>
"But listen," she leaned toward him with some sudden
access of emotion.  "I can do this much!  I'll agree
to bring in Charley Halsey, bound hand and foot!  You
can throw him and me, too, on the scrap heap when
the time comes!  It's a game.  I'll play it.  I'll take my
chance."  She half rose, thrilling, vibrant.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would, Jennie."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but you'll have to pay."
</p>

<p>
"Have I ever said I wouldn't?  Didn't I just get
done telling him I'd make him rich the minute he said
the word?"
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't seem to be money he wants.
I&mdash;don't&mdash;believe&mdash;that's what the pay would have to be."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?  You're getting too deep for
me now.  I'm only a plain man, my girl!"
</p>

<p>
She smiled at him, still enigmatic, still cool and
calm, still almost insolent, as she often was with him.
"He's been talking all sorts of folly about getting
things in tune&mdash;getting gravitation in tune with
labor&mdash;all sorts of abstractions.  Well, don't you see, if
I got in tune with his notions, I might be able to
influence him!"
</p>

<p>
Rawn grew cold and hard.  "There's one thing we
can't do, Jennie," said he.  "We can't side in with any
of his socialistic talk.  What <i>he</i> wants to do is to give
to the people of this country for nothing what this
International Power Company is planning to <i>sell</i> them
for ever.  What <i>we</i> want is monopoly!  I've been
gambling everything I've got on the certainty of that
monopoly.  I'm in soak, in hock, up to my eyes on the
market, this minute.  I'm margined to the full extent
of my credit.  The biggest men of America are back
of me.  I'll be rich if this thing goes through&mdash;one of
the richest men in America.  But I'd almost rather lose
it all than to see you side in with him, or listen for
five minutes to his rotten talk about the 'rights of
man.'  There <i>are</i> no rights of man except what each
man can take for himself!  As for him, I'd kill him,
or get him killed, if I knew first how he got that
current through the receivers.  Give me that, and I'll let
the rights of man wait a while.  I'll show them a thing
or two!
</p>

<p>
"But of course," he added, frowning again in helpless
perturbation, "we've got to get him in hand.
Grace couldn't do it."
</p>

<p>
"No; on the contrary.  I can&mdash;if I pay!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Then pay!</i>" he snarled suddenly, his voice harsh,
half choking.  "What's the price&mdash;nothing worth
mentioning.  But it's got to be paid, no matter what it is.
We're caught, and we're squeezed!  We've got to pay,
<i>no matter what it is</i>, Jennie!"
</p>

<p>
"Is it no matter to you, Mr. Rawn?"
</p>

<p>
"How can it be?  I'm almost crazy to-night!  Do it,
that's all, and draw on me to the limit!"
</p>

<p>
"To the limit, Mr. Rawn?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>To the limit!</i>"  He looked her straight in the eye,
and she met his gaze fully.  She shivered slightly
again, but her delicately clean-cut face showed no
further sign.  Only she shivered, and pulled her wrap a
trifle closer about her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," she said.  "I may have to draw on
you&mdash;and myself, too."
</p>

<p>
"It's all in the game, Jennie&mdash;we've got to play it
together&mdash;we're two of the same sort&mdash;we've got to
climb, to succeed.  We run well together.  One must
help the other's hand."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's a game," she answered; and so rose, and
left him without further word.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
John Rawn followed her up the stair, mumbling
some sort of conjugal affection, but she left him at
the landing and passed toward her own apartments
down the hall, giving him hardly even a look of farewell.
He followed her with his eyes, standing a little
time, his hand resting on the lintel of his own door.
</p>

<p>
Alone, Rawn seated himself in the Elizabethan armchair
devised by his most favored decorator as fitting
for this Elizabethan room.  A vast oak bed, heavily
carved, with deep and heavy curtains, represented the
decorator's idea of what the Virgin Queen preferred.
The walls were deeply carved in wainscot and cornice.
A rude attempt was made at strength and simplicity
in this, the sanctum of the master of Graystone Hall.
Granted the aid of a lively imagination, this might
have been the apartment of some feudal lord of another
day; as the designer and architect had not failed
delicately to suggest to Mr. Rawn.
</p>

<p>
It is possible that in the time of Elizabeth pier
glasses with heavily carved frames were not common
in the size affected by Mr. Rawn in his private
apartment.  He stood before the great glass now and gazed
at what he saw; a face haggard and lined, shoulders
stooping a little forward, body a little stooped, a little
heavy, a little soft; the watch charm hanging in free
air&mdash;the figure of a man no longer athletic, if ever so.
</p>

<p>
Rawn stood engaged in his regular nightly
devotions&mdash;he made no prayers of eventide beyond that to
his mirror.  But now something he saw caused him to
fling himself into a seat at a smaller glass, where the
light was better.  He gazed into this also, intently.
Something seemed strange about his eyes, about his
mouth.  He turned his face slightly sidewise and
studied the deep triangular lines at the corner of the
chin.  He saw a roll of fat at the back of his neck, and
observed a certain throatiness, a voluminousness of
flesh below the chin.  The latter stood out distinct,
pushing forward;&mdash;the rich man's chin, the old man's
chin.  He lifted a finger and touched the arteries on
his temples.  They were firmer to the touch than once
they had been.  He looked at the veins on his hands,
and realized that they stood fuller than was once the
case.  His nose, large, just a trifle bulbous, seemed to
him to have gained somewhat in color in late years.
He looked at his eyes in eager questioning.  Yes, they
belonged to him!  But for some reason they lacked
brilliance and fire.  They were colder, less impressive,
less responsive;&mdash;the rich man's eyes, the old man's
eyes.  He looked at his hair, now almost white at the
temples.  He hesitated for a moment, then picked up
a hand glass and deliberately turned his back to the
mirror.  Yes, it was there, a shiny spot of naked
epidermis.  He knew that, but always he shunned the
knowledge and the proof.  For many years his thick
mane of wiry hair had been his pride.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn turned and put the hand mirror on the
dresser top again.  He looked full into the glass at his
image once more.  His pendulous lower lip drooped,
tremulously.  He saw his eyes winking.  He saw something
else.  Yes, to his wonder, to his gasping horror,
he saw something strange and revolutionary!  A tear
was standing in the corner of his eye!  It dropped, it
trickled down his cheek.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn for the first time in his life was learning
what the one game is&mdash;and learning that time is
the one winner in that one game!  He was old.

CHAPTER VI
<br />
AN INFORMAL MEETING
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
It must surprise those simple folk, Messieurs
Washington, Jefferson, and their like, were they to
return to life at this advanced day and gaze upon the
admirable republic which they fancied to be founded
on immutable principles.  As in politics to-day those
principles would seem proved to have been not quite
immutable, so, in commerce, men and methods would
appear wholly different from those known in that
earlier day.  For instance, in commercial matters, the
men of that day would now find in daily application
a fourth dimension of affairs once wholly unknown;
the sixth sense of the modern business man, a
delicately differentiated faculty evolved in the holy of
holies where events cast their financial shadows far
in advance of themselves.  John Jay, or any financier
of Revolutionary time, very likely lacked in that
regard, and had but his five senses.
</p>

<p>
This keen sense of prophecy, property of modern
leaders in finance, was not lacking in the case of the
directors of the International Power Company, all and
several; and more especially several.  Capitalists hunt
in packs&mdash;but only up to a certain point.  The <i>sauve
qui peut</i> has small chivalry about it even in the holy
of holies.
</p>

<p>
Within a few days after the turbulent scenes which
took place in the quiet surroundings of Graystone
Hall, there was held, quite informally, indeed on a
wholly impromptu basis, a meeting of the greater
portion of the directors of the International Power
Company.  It was a meeting not called by the president,
and the president knew nothing of it.  It was not set
for the usual headquarters in the East; on the
contrary, by merest chance, these keen-witted men met
by accident in the western city where were located the
works and central operating offices of the International
Power Company.  They made their stopping place, as
usual, at the National Union Club, where they were
less certain to become the prey of prying reporters&mdash;a
breed detested above all things by these and their
like.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
There was, this afternoon, casually present, a
certain gray-haired, full-bodied man, of full beard and
rather portly body.  He was speaking with President
Standley, of St. Louis, who also by merest chance
happened to be in town.  To them presently came the
former general traffic manager of Mr. Standley's road,
Ackerman, also present by merest accident.  Two or
three others, moreover, by mere accident, joined them,
figures which were familiar at the long table in the
New York headquarters.  They looked at one another
frankly, and laughed without much reservation.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Ackerman, after a time, "let's sit down
and have a little powwow&mdash;informally, you know."
</p>

<p>
The gray-haired man grinned pleasantly again and
said nothing, but drew up a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, you know," said Standley, as he seated
himself, "that our dissatisfied friend, Van, is here in
town to-day?"
</p>

<p>
The full-bearded man nodded, and an instant later
jerked his head toward the door.  "He's here in the
club, too," said he, and smiled.  "Just happened in, I
suppose."  Indeed, as they turned to look they saw
advancing, talking animatedly, a rather slender,
youngish man of brown eyes and pointed beard; none less
than the disgruntled director who had long ago been
so summarily handled by John Rawn, president of the
International Power Company.
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't he got the nose for news, though?"
commented Standley admiringly.  "Now, who told him
there was anything doing!"
</p>

<p>
"He didn't need to have anybody tell him," growled
Ackerman.  "He can take care of himself.  And by
Jove!  I'm half inclined to think that he was the lucky
one&mdash;to get out the way he did, and when he did."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he's lucky," said Standley gravely.  He turned
to see the vast round belly of the gray-bearded man
heaving in silent mirth.  The railway magnate
obviously was amused.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know!" remarked Ackerman suddenly.
"<i>Others</i>, eh?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
"Well, boys, why not admit it?" rejoined the older
man.  "We all know the facts.  We all know why we're
here.  As you said, Ack, let's hold a little informal
meeting, and talk over what we had better do!"
</p>

<p>
"How much did you sell!" demanded Standley
casually.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty thousand last week.  You sold about
double that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's leaking out, no use denying that!  You
don't need to list this thing&mdash;it leaks!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, Van's buying it," said Standley,
nodding toward the slender figure of the ex-director.
"First time I ever knew him to go out for revenge.
It doesn't very often pay."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can't figure it out," ventured Ackerman.
"The stock won't do him any more good than it does
us.  He can't get the control over that old bonehead
Rawn&mdash;I mean our respected president&mdash;anyhow, any
more than we can.  He's sitting tight, with the papers
in his box.  I admit that I let go a little, because I
figured it was time we were doing something better than
six per cent. with that stock, and all Rawn has done
is to make one explanation on top of another.  He can't
keep on putting that across with me, anyhow.  But
he can sit there, as I say, with the control in his hands,
looking at those nice pictures of the Lady of the
Lightnings, which he had engraved as our trademark."
</p>

<p>
"He's awfully gone on her," spoke up one.  "Not
that I blame him, either.  I hate to sell my stock,
because I like the looks of our engraved goddess so
much!"
</p>

<p>
"There's most always a lady standing around
somewhere, with the lightning in her hands," ventured the
gray-bearded man solemnly.  They looked at one
another again suggestively, but no one spoke more
definite words than that.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"Well, we've had high-sounding talk put up to us
about long enough," commented Ackerman, at length.
"I was one of the first to go in for this, and I believe
in it yet, but I don't want this thing with Rawn in
control.  Why, look at him,&mdash;he was just a clerk when he
came to us, and here he's putting on more side than
any other man in the town.  He's taken advantage of
his situation to play the market in and out, all the
time, which he couldn't have done if it hadn't been for
friends like us.  He squeezed us into backing him&mdash;after
we gave him that first little flyer in Rubber, and
some Oil&mdash;that hadn't cost us anything and didn't look
worth anything.  In return he's handed us promises
and explanations and hot air, and nothing else.  I've
just got an idea that there's a man-sized nigger
somewhere around this woodpile.  For me, I prefer being
hung as a little lamb rather than as a full-sized goat.
Yes, I let go a little International&mdash;to Van&mdash;I'll
admit.  Time enough to get back into the game when
we've put Rawn out!"
</p>

<p>
Standley nodded slowly.  "That's a good deal the
way I felt about it," he said.  "It riles me to see the
airs that fellow puts on.  I remember him when he
didn't have two suits of hand-me-down clothes to his
name, and now he seems to have a hundred, all done
by the best tailors in New York.  He used to tie his
drawers with white tape strings, and now he wears
specially shaped silks.  Where'd he get it?  You talk
about the Keeley motor&mdash;this thing has got it beat a
mile for mystery.  And we fellows have been
standing for that!  That is, unless we can stand from
under, somehow."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, seemingly," ventured the last speaker.  "But
how is that somehow?  There isn't any market for
International."
</p>

<p>
The gray-bearded man laughed jubilantly at this.
"Have you found that out?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I certainly have found it out.  Of course, the
market has been Van yonder.  But he won't take on
over a certain amount.  He wants to break the control,
of course.  But he's going to wait until he gets up to
the point and then do something quick.  He's not
going to hold our bag for us&mdash;oh, no!  Not him!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've a suspicion," said the older man finally,
"that that secret we've been after has been in the hands
of our superintendent for a long time."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't Rawn tell us, then?" demanded one of
his companions.  "Has he sold us out?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Rawn hasn't sold us out.  At least I don't think
so."
</p>

<p>
"Who has, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  The young man who made the
wheels go for us whenever Rawn wanted him to&mdash;he's
the real key to this situation, if I'm a good guesser.
There's your contraband, and you can locate him
somewhere in this particular woodpile, or I'm no
judge."
</p>

<p>
"Rawn's pretty well spread out in the general
market," quite irrelevantly suggested Standley.
</p>

<p>
"I should say he was!" growled Ackerman.  "He's
been in on all the good things in the last two or three
years.  He must have made millions&mdash;I don't know
how much."
</p>

<p>
"In the general market&mdash;not International, of
course.  He's got all his holdings in that.  He has been
spending money, though!"  Standley wagged his head.
</p>

<p>
"For instance, on the Lady of the Lightnings?"
suggested Ackerman, grinning amiably.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, on his young wife, and his new house, and his
boats, and his automobiles, and all the regular things.
He can't have done it out of International dividends,
that's sure!"
</p>

<p>
"All the better that he hasn't," ventured Standley.
The old man nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Go over there and call Van," he said simply.

<p>
The slender man with pointed beard came up pleasantly,
his eyes twinkling.  "Well, my fellow sports and
department heads!" he said.  "What's the good word
this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," said the gray-bearded man.  "We know
why you're here, and why you've been hanging around
here for the last six months.  It's foolish of you, son,
to be out for revenge&mdash;nothing in that!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not after revenge," smiled the other, his eyes
still twinkling.  "I've made my peace!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," commented Ackerman.  "The friendship of
some of you gladiators is surely a wonderful thing!
Rawn hates you, and you hate Rawn.  Don't your ears
burn?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my heart!"  He laid a hand on that organ with
mock gravity.
</p>

<p>
"What could you do with the Lady of the Lightnings,
Van?" asked Standley discreetly.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, absolutely nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't she any social instincts?"
</p>

<p>
"Plenty, but all gratified; that's the trouble.  There
isn't anything those people want that they haven't got.
No, I must say his position is pretty strong."
</p>

<p>
"But it's not impregnable, Standley," cut in the
gray-bearded man, stopping the twiddling of his
fingers above his round-paunched body.  "Now, look here,
we're all friends together, when it comes to that.  You
belong with us a lot more than you do with that
Jasper from the country.  Of course, you split with us,
got mad, took your dolls and all that sort of thing&mdash;we're
all used to that&mdash;and we all sat tight because it
looked good.  It looked better than it does now.  So,
we're friends again."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," nodded the slight man.  "I understand
that."
</p>

<p>
"Sure you do!  Now, it's plain that when it comes to
being on the inside, you're there as an ex-director
just as much as we are as real directors&mdash;maybe more
so, for all I know."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe more, yes, that's so," smiled the slender
man, his brown eyes twinkling yet more.
</p>

<p>
"How much more, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, a whole lot more!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I know what I've learned for myself and by myself.
Gentlemen, it's on the table!  Play the game!  I
did.  I've had some of those college professors at work
for me&mdash;they're the people that first got us locoed,
anyhow.  Rawn, or rather his son-in-law, got his first
notion from his own professor in his college."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
"The real trouble with business to-day," interrupted
the gray-bearded man, reverting to his universal and
invariable grievance, "is that things are all going
wrong with the American people.  These Progressives
down there at Washington have set this whole
country by the ears&mdash;not even the Supreme Court can
square things any more.  The suspiciousness of the
average man is getting to be almost criminal, that's
what it is.  The public thinks every man with money is
a rascal.  The public is damnably ungrateful.  Look
what we have done for this country, this little set of
men sitting right here&mdash;what we've built for them,
what we've paid out to them for wages!  What are we
getting in return?  They envy us our daily bread, and
by the Eternal! they'll come near putting us where
we can't get that much longer!  Look at the railway
rate cases&mdash;it's robbery of the railways.  Capital hasn't
any chance any more!  The public seems to be getting
ready for anarchy; that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it the truth?" remarked the slender man
sympathetically.  "Still, we have to handle men as we find
them, my friends.  In my own case, I've been fighting
the devil with a little of his own fire."
</p>

<p>
"How's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, for instance, I went out to see if I couldn't
land that little secret of the receiving motor myself,
as I just told you.  If International doesn't want to
take me in, or if I can't break in, maybe there can be
another company formed&mdash;there's considerable
corporation room left in New Jersey.  You folks on the
International have been having your own troubles with
labor, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, rather!" growled Ackerman.  "We put that
up to old Colonel J. R. Bonehead, our president!  He
seems to have got in about as nearly wrong as any one
could with our esteemed friends of the labor unions!"
</p>

<p>
"Naturally; well, I'll make a confession, since we're
all friends together&mdash;I've had men conferring with
your horny-handed citizens and suggesting that the
International Power Company was 'unfair,' and a bad
outfit to work for!"
</p>

<p>
"That was nice of you!" growled Ackerman, getting
red in the face.  "<i>Fine</i> business, for you to come
snooping around our works."
</p>

<p>
The slender man smiled at him pleasantly.  "How
else could I get information?" he inquired.  "You must
remember that I'm no longer on the board!  But you
must remember, also, that of late I have picked up an
occasional dollar's worth of International.  I wanted
to know how about certain things!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, how about them, then?" demanded Standley
fiercely.  "Where do we stand?"
</p>

<p>
"You want me to incriminate myself!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fiddlesticks about incrimination!  Cut out that
part of it!"
</p>

<p>
"All right, I will," said the other grimly.  "Well,
then, I've tried my best to bribe your people, and I've
got little out of it.  I've tried the foreman, the night
watchman, and everybody else.  I've had a dozen of
your workmen slugged for scabbing, and four or five
of them shot, one or two at least, for a good,
permanent funeral.  And I paid the funeral expenses!  You
didn't know that?  Well, that's the truth of it!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, <i>what</i> do you know about that!" gasped
Standley, aghast.
</p>

<p>
"I know a good deal about it, my Christian friend,"
said the slender man relentlessly.  "I can tell you what
you already know, that your motors are dismantled
to-day.  I can tell you also that there's a very good
chance that the secret we've been after is in the hands
of one man, and he's holding it up for some reason
best known to himself.  We've got nothing on him!
I can also tell you that if he won't give up&mdash;though
<i>why</i> he won't, I can't imagine&mdash;it's possible we can
work out a receiver of our own elsewhere, without
him."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
"Well, what does he want?"  This from the old man.
</p>

<p>
"That's the everlasting mystery and puzzle of it.
He doesn't want anything, so far as I can learn.
There's some factor in him that I can't get my hands
on, try the best that I can.  Not that I don't expect to
break you wide open eventually, my friends."
</p>

<p>
"Now why do you want to do that?" asked the older
financier.  "Why not join in with us and break the
bonehead?"
</p>

<p>
"Fine!  But how can we do that?  He's sitting
pretty tight.  The man's played in fine luck.  I admit
I rather admire him."
</p>

<p>
"Bah, that's the way with all the new ones; they all
play in luck for a time.  Each Napoleon has his boom,
but after a time boom values shrink&mdash;they always do.
This chap'll find his level when we get ready to tell
him."
</p>

<p>
"For instance?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, for instance, then!  He's sitting there with
a small margin of control in the International.  That
gave him his start, and he's wise enough to hang on
to that.  But it didn't give him his money&mdash;he's only
made dividend money out of that; and who cares for
dividend money?  He doesn't own control in the
Guatemala Oil Company, does he?  He's made a lot
out of Arizona and Utah coppers, but he doesn't own
control in a single company there, does he?  He's in
with the L.P., but he borrowed to get in.  He's made
a big killing in Rubber, but he doesn't own any Rubber
control of his own, does he?  Now, you follow him
out in every deal he's made&mdash;-iron, copper, steel, oil,
rails, timber, irrigation, utilities, industrials&mdash;and
you'll find he's simply been banking on his inside
information and his outside credit.  Who gave him both
of those things?&mdash;Why, we did, didn't we?  All right!
Suppose we withdraw our credit.  What happens?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
They went silent now, and grouped a little closer
about the tabouret which stood between them.  The
old man's voice went on evenly, with no excitement.
Their conversation attracted the attention of none in
the wide lounging room, where large affairs more than
once had been discussed&mdash;even the making of Senators
to order.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what happens," the old man resumed.
"He quits using us for a stalking horse, and he comes
down to his own system.  He's spread out.  Banks are
all polite, but&mdash;well, he has to put up collateral; and
then some more.  If he doesn't want to put up International,
he's apt to find that a bunch of automobiles is
poor property when sold at twenty per cent. their cost.
He turns off two or three butlers, but still that doesn't
serve for margins.  The market doesn't suit his book
any more.
</p>

<p>
"He's discovering now the great truth of something
any old friend Emory Storrs used to say&mdash;Emory
always was in debt, or wanted to be, and says he:
'There's no trouble about prosperity in this country;
there's plenty of money&mdash;the only trouble is in the
confounded scarcity in <i>collateral</i>.'  Well, he goes over
to this young man, who is standing out for some
reason best known to himself, and he tries to get him to
come through, and he doesn't come through.  What's
left?  Why, the diamond lightnings of the Lady of the
Lightnings&mdash;and his International Power stock.
</p>

<p>
"Meantime, all this thing can't be kept entirely
secret; that is to say, the market part of it can't be.
But we sit tight, all of us.  We hold our regular
directors' meetings of the International board, and we
smile, and look pleasant.  We don't know a thing
about his hot water experiences in the open market.
He explains to us why this and that happens, or doesn't
happen, in International; and we smile and look
pleasant, and we don't know a thing.  After a time it's up
to him and the Lady of the Lightnings.  Something
pops!  He's up against it, all except his International
Power.  Then Van, and you, Standley, and you, Ack,
and you, and you and I, and all of us&mdash;why we're still
pleasant as pie to him and we say, 'Well, Mr. John
Rawn, if you'd only sell us two or three shares of
International, we'd pay you twenty times what it's
worth&mdash;but it's very much cheaper now&mdash;by reason of Van's
competing company!'
</p>

<p>
"That's about all, I think!"
</p>

<p>
The others nodded silently.  The game was not new
to them, and even in its most complicated features
might have been called simple, with resources such as
theirs.  If these resources had made Rawn, they could
unmake him.  It was all in the day's work for them.
</p>

<p>
"So I'll tell you what we'll do," concluded the old
financier after a time.  "We'll just let you and Van
look around here a little bit and see what more you
can learn.  You're one of the real directors of
International Power to-day, Van.  Mr. Rawn is on the
minority and the toboggan list, or is going to be there.
We'll take the first steps when we see the boys down
East.  The country's getting right now for a little
speculation&mdash;things have been dead long enough.
There'll be a market.  When the market starts, I think
you know which way it will go for a certain person I
needn't name."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
They rose, stood about loungingly for a time, and
at length slowly separated, the older man and the
ex-director with the pointed beard falling back of the
others for just an instant.
</p>

<p>
"What's the truth about the row, Van?" demanded
the old man, laying a large, pudgy hand on the other's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, honestly, what it is.  I can tell you
this much&mdash;your factory is closed.  Your superintendent,
Halsey, has quit his work and left his old
residence.  Didn't Rawn tell you <i>that</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"No!  What's up now&mdash;some trouble with a
woman?  Wasn't he married to Rawn's daughter?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and she went to live with Papa.  Papa had
the coin."
</p>

<p>
"And the superintendent is going the chorus girl
route here or in New York?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, not in the least,&mdash;nothing of the sort.  You
can't guess where he's gone."
</p>

<p>
The other shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll tell you then, since you are one of the
directors of the International and I'm not!  He's gone
and taken his other pair of pants and his celluloid
collar, and moved over to the North Shore!  He's
living in the same house with Papa J. Rawn right
now;&mdash;that is to say, he has been for two or three weeks."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you know about that, too!"
commented his friend.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know much about it.  As I told you, there's
something in here I don't understand.  I can't for the
life of me figure out that chap Halsey's motives or
his moves.  But I don't care about him.  It's Rawn I'm
after&mdash;and I'm going to get him!"
</p>

<p><a id="chap0407"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
THEY WHO SOW THE WIND
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
The information given by the ex-director in
regard to the whereabouts of Charles Halsey was
substantially, if not circumstantially, correct.  He had,
indeed, done the most unlikely thing.  He had taken up
his abode, for the time at least, at the very place to
which he might have seemed least apt to return; that
is to say, the home of his father-in-law, John Rawn.
</p>

<p>
Many things moved Halsey to this action.  In the
first place, having ended his labors, he found no
reason for any pretense of continuing them.  Again,
although he fully intended to bring divorce proceedings,
and fully intended to leave the city, he was unwilling
to depart without seeing once more his wife and their
child, because news came to him of the little cripple's
serious and continued illness.  In point of fact, Grace
Halsey, unhappy, morose, and now jealously suspicious,
had brooded over her unfortunate situation in
life until she also really was ill.  Halsey grieved over
this, in spite of all.  As to the little hunchback, Laura,
she had known only illness all her life; and Halsey,
father after all, felt some foreboding which made him
unready to leave for yet a time.
</p>

<p>
Halsey, in spite of his own bitterness of soul,
realized that Rawn himself was well-nigh crazed by the
business situation, and his conscience misgave him
when he reflected upon the sudden consequences of
his own acts.  His sense of business honor and of
personal justice told him he owed even so unreasonable a
man as Rawn some sort of definite accounting for his
own stewardship, unwelcome as another meeting
between them must be to both.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, it may be added, Virginia Rawn had sent for
him.
</p>

<p>
When he received her message he spent a night
resolving that he would not go, that he would never
again see either her or Grace; never again would set
foot on ground belonging to John Rawn, come what
could, let be lost what any of them all might lose.  In
the morning he changed his resolution.  By evening of
the next day he was at Graystone Hall.
</p>

<p>
To his surprise, he found it not immediately
necessary to patch a peace with the master of Graystone
Hall, for Rawn was absent.  The great mansion seemed
strangely and suddenly changed.  An air of anxiety
hung over all, the place was oddly silent.  The
servants went slipshod about their duties, and their
mistress did not chide them.  Swift disintegration of the
domestic machine seemed to threaten; mysterious
danger seemed to menace the very structure itself, long
of so bold and indomitable front.  Halsey still
hesitated&mdash;and still remained.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Rawn customarily divided his time between the
operating headquarters in the western city and the
general offices in the eastern capital, but now he had
found it needful immediately to transfer all his activities
to the latter scene.  He did not know of his wife's
invitation to Halsey, for he had started from his office,
without even advising her of his intention, and even
without conversation with her by telephone.  He
telegraphed from the train, stating that he had been
called East on urgent matters.  After that, no word at
all came from him.  It was not known when he would
return.  Halsey could only wait.  In truth, he was
little better than a man gone mad himself, and Rawn
was worse than such.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, day by day, hour by hour, the terrible
strain of this suddenly developed situation began to
show its effects upon Rawn.  He slept but little after
his arrival in the East, showed himself more and more
untidy in personal habits; and lastly, began to seek
the false strength of intoxicating drink.  His demeanor
in his relations with his urbane associates daily lost
its usual arrogance.  John Rawn, late dictator, became
explanatory, conciliatory&mdash;a change of mind which had
visible physical tokens.  His eye became weaker and
more watery, his shoulders more drooped, his voice
more quavering, his address less abrupt and domineering.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn was a broken man, and began to show
it.  Wherefore his late friends exulted.  The wolves,
ranged in circle, lick their chops when the wounded
bull totters upon his uncertain legs.  Certain large
financial figures in the eastern city licked their chops,
and smiled grimly, wolfishly, in contemplation of John
Rawn as he tottered.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Yet Rawn himself could get no direct proof of the
identity of those now secretly assailing him.  At the
directors' meetings of the International he was
received politely and respectfully&mdash;with too much
politeness and respect, as he felt, although himself unlike
the man once wont to rule there with an iron hand.
He did not dare tell them of Halsey's defection, could
not doubt that they already knew of it; but he met no
queries regarding that or anything else in the conduct
of the western factory's business.  No one seemed to
know that the most important of all their factories
was closed, after a tedious term spent in incompletion.
His associates all were as polite as himself,
indeed, more so; as ready as himself to discuss gravely
and earnestly any detail of the business which now, as
all politely agreed, seemed "somewhat involved," or
"somewhat delayed."  No one offered any criticism of
the executive.
</p>

<p>
But, what was far more deadly to him, the market
seemed most onerously and cruelly oppressive upon
the outside investments of John Rawn.  International
Power was not hammered, for the reason that there
was little of it out to hammer.  The Rawn stock in
International, of course, did not come upon the market.
Rawn intended to hold on to that grimly, fighting for
it to the last gasp, trusting to chance to mend matters
for him at the eleventh hour.  But ruin in the general
market faced him; and he knew that, with credit gone,
the courts would take for his former creditors
whatever property he could be shown to have.  He saw the
shadowy circle of the wolves of high finance.  Almost
he felt their fangs snapping at his hamstrings.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
In these savage hours the mind of John Rawn cast
about for rescue, for hope.  No rescue, no hope,
appeared except one last desperate alternative,
purchasable not now with cash or power or influence&mdash;since
these were gone&mdash;but with what other and dearer
things remain to a man&mdash;things some men, not rotted
with the love of self, keep through any or all disaster,
prize, even above life and all a life's business success.
Halsey!  Ah!  Halsey was the savior of Rawn&mdash;Halsey,
the man who had humiliated him in his own home.
How could Halsey be secured?  There might be
brought to bear upon him one influence&mdash;that of a
beautiful and fascinating woman!  What matter if the
one woman, was his wife, Virginia Rawn?  He had
already hinted to her of her duty.  He wondered
now continually whether she had really and fully
understood.  He wondered what she was doing with
Halsey.
</p>

<p>
As to Halsey, who knew little or nothing of all these
turbulent emotions, all these crowding incidents, he
found his situation in the great house of John Rawn
one wholly to his dislike.  He saw little of his wife
Grace after the first conventional greeting on his
arrival, and as to the young mistress of Graystone Hall,
she seemed so regularly to have matters demanding
her own presence elsewhere, was so busy with other
matters, as to have small time for him.  The disturbed
condition of the stock market was creating a furor
in the business world, reflected, of course, in the daily
markets of the western city; but Halsey had never
had many investments, had watched the markets
little; and now, isolated at Graystone Hall almost as
much as though upon a desert island, and too much
disturbed and distracted in his own mind to find any
definite interest in business matters, was hardly
conscious of the storm that raged.  He simply waited on,
unhappily.  It seemed to him there was no place for him
in all the world.  Why did Virginia remain aloof?
</p>

<p>
Rawn, absent in New York, imagined his wife
engaged continuously in the struggle of persuading
Charles Halsey to see the light of reason, although he
did not know Halsey was living under the same roof
with her.  As a matter of fact, Halsey and she met
but rarely.  Virginia breakfasted for the most part in
her own rooms, and found, or pretended to find,
something to occupy her for the most part of the day.  Not
once did she ask his attendance, not once did she speak
with him, when by chance she saw him, upon any but
casual or conventional matters.  She seemed always
to evade him; and because she did this, he, rebelling,
sought her out all the more, even while continually
resolving to take his departure, and never again to
see this place, or her, again.  He wondered at her
reticence, her avoidance of him.  He wondered why she
was so pale.  He loitered about, unhappily, in this or
that common meeting ground of the great mansion
house, waiting to hear the rustle of a gown upon the
stair, the sound of a light foot on a floor, the touch
of a white hand, the sound of a voice&mdash;all things
belonging, not to his wife, but to his young stepmother
by law.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Yes.  Without his wish, in spite of her wish, these
had become things desired, the only things desirable any
more in his distracted life.  He lived under the same
roof with two women, saw either rarely, and rarely
thought of but one&mdash;the wrong one.  To atone, Halsey
lavished all his time and care on his little hunchback
daughter, and had her with him as much as the nurse
and doctor would allow.  The child, undersized, pale,
deformed, silent and wistful, and pathetic always, now
was listless and weak, obviously very seriously ill.  It
wrung her father's heart to see her.  But Charles
Halsey wanted it wrung.  He wanted to do bitterest
penance for what he now knew was his secret sin.  So the
ways of inordinate power, the consequences, for this
one or that one, which follow on inordinate greed,
worked themselves on out toward their sure and logical
ending, the mill of fate grinding those primarily,
secondarily, even incidentally guilty.
</p>

<p>
At this time, had Virginia Rawn asked of him to
recant, to relent, to change, there is likelihood he
would have done so.  John Rawn, cuckold, was right
in his despicable reasoning.  There are many prices
which purchase principles.  The weakness which had
prompted Halsey to remain at Graystone Hall on such
a tenure&mdash;which held him there now, waiting for a
voice, listening for a footfall&mdash;was the ancient
weakness of youth before youth, of strength before beauty,
of the empty heart before one offering love, of the
mind finding perfect echo in another mind.
</p>

<p>
With all his starved heart, all his repressed soul, all
his mutinous body, Charles Halsey loved Virginia
Rawn.

<p>
As at last the news of John Rawn's collapse broke
full and fair&mdash;disastrous enough to please even his
late warmest friends.  The stock markets, East and
West, became scenes of riot.  The truth, of course, had
leaked out regarding Rawn's fight in the last ditch.  The
newspapers swarmed upon Graystone Hall, besieging
any who could be found.  Halsey refused to talk, and
moreover, Rawn could not be found.  This threw them
upon their own resources, and what they did not know
they imagined.  Even thus, the wildest of them all could
not imagine half; the shrewdest of the journalists
could not get their hands on the "inside story" here.
No one in or around or back of the stock exchanges
could be found possessed of secret information which
he was willing to impart.  Throughout wild hours of
hurrying, telegraphing, investigating, the papers kept
up their frenzied search for the truth, and found it not,
and knew they had not found it.
</p>

<p>
Halsey, one morning after a sleepless night, more
than a week after Rawn's departure to New York,
secured copies of each of the morning papers.  He stood
uncertain, in the great central room of Graystone Hall,
with these black and frowning messengers of fate in
his hands, scarce daring to look at them.  He felt some
sense of definite disaster at hand.  He glanced at last
at one, and started as though struck.  Calling a
servant, he sent word to Mrs. Rawn inquiring if he might
meet her at once.
</p>

<p>
She joined him presently, smiling faintly, giving
him her hand, then leading him to a breakfast table on
the long gallery facing the lake front, a favorite spot
with her.  She gave the butler orders to serve them
breakfast here at once; for she now learned Halsey
had neither slept nor eaten.  Halsey did not learn that
the same also was true of her.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
They seated themselves and for the time said
nothing, each gazing out over the lake.  The morning was
calm and beautiful.  The blue lake, just dotted with
little whitecap rolling waves, seemed in amiable mood,
and purred gently along the sea-wall, below the green
and curving terrace which ran down from the gallery
front.  A bird chirped here and there.
</p>

<p>
Little enough the peaceful scene reflected the
feelings of these, its only human figures.  Virginia Rawn
was pale.  Dark rings showed below her eyes.  Her
mouth drooped just a trifle, plaintively, in a way not
usual with her.  She was pale, paler than her usual
clean and clear ivory.  Yet she was coolly beautiful
in her morning gown of light figured lawn, with its
wide, flowing sleeves, showing her round white arms.
Halsey, frowningly serious, felt the charm of her rise
about him, overwhelm him.  He knew that the hour
had come for him in more ways than one; that hers,
for ever, was the one face and figure and voice and
presence for him, hopeless and unhappy, and doomed
for ever so to remain.  She was not his wife.  She was
the wife of another man&mdash;of his enemy; the man in all
the world least like himself; the man who, by virtue
of that unlikeness, had won this woman for his own.
What hope for him, Charles Halsey, for whom was no
place in the world?
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
Without much comment he placed before her the
morning papers, with their glaring head-lines.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said he, "it is the end."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" said she, smiling; "I suppose now we can
learn all about our earlier life and career?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite so.  Here is the entire history of Mr. Rawn's
career&mdash;what he did when he was a young man, where
he came from, how he rose to power, how he failed
and fell&mdash;it's all here.  Here's the story of the
International Power Company&mdash;they claim it was intended
as a merger of all the traction companies of the eight
leading cities of the country!  Bond issue one to eight
billion dollars, capitalization one to two hundred
billion in stocks&mdash;you can take your choice in crazed
figures.  Here are biographical histories of all the known
and unknown stock-holders.  Here, Mrs. Rawn, is a
picture of yourself, as well as one of Mr. Rawn and
one more of the house here&mdash;a new view, I think.  The
photographer must have made a flashlight of the
grounds."
</p>

<p>
She smiled as he tried to jest, following his pointing
finger along the blurred, brutal head-lines, shrieking
their discordant, impossible and inconsistent tales.
The first paper, the <i>Forum</i>, declared the ruin of John
Rawn's fortune to be now beyond all hope of repair.
Rawn himself&mdash;really at that time often in a helpless
stupor in a New York hotel room&mdash;was reported to
have fled the country.  Halsey, his son-in-law, and
Halsey's wife, who really had only denied themselves
to visitors and reporters&mdash;were declared to be in
hiding in some secret apartments of the great castle on
the North Shore, a place actually but little known to
any member of the select North Side society in which
Rawn had been, more or less on sufferance, received.
Rawn's wife was also located here, in a condition
verging on insanity; according to the imagination of
the writers, which, after all, was fatefully near to the
truth.
</p>

<p>
Virginia Rawn smiled, and turned the pages.  The
next journal had little else but detailed discussion of
the Rawn collapse.  It also asserted the scheme of the
International Power Company was the most bold and
rapacious fraud of the day.  With journalistic vaticination
it insouciantly declared that the intention of
the company was to establish central distributing
points for power stolen from the public's great water
powers, and the retail of what the journal in the argot
of the day called canned power, in cheap and portable
small motors applicable to countless semi-mechanical
uses, all with an end of abolishing the need for horse
power and for man power alike.  The result, it pointed
out, would be the throwing out of work of countless
thousands of laboring men by the use of electricity
stolen from the people themselves.  The gigantic
combination already was covering the main water powers.
The people's present openly had been disregarded,
the people's future openly and patently had been
put in the gravest of peril.  The entire system of
government had been laid by the heels.  The name
of the republic had been made a mockery.  Above all,
it was asserted, the most intimate intent of the
International Power Company had been the throttling of the
labor unions&mdash;against which John Rawn was known
to be personally bitterly opposed&mdash;the very essence
and soul of the conspiracy having been this device
whose aim was to wipe out the need of unskilled labor,
and to make useless and unpaid the power of human
brawn.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Following these assertions&mdash;which after all were not
in the least bad journalism, however good or bad had
been the design of International Power&mdash;the same
journal exultantly declared that labor need not yet despair,
for that the gigantic conspiracy now had fallen in
ruins; its leader had abdicated and fled, and his
ill-gotten gains had been dissipated in his last desperate
attempt to save his holdings in other stocks.  In his
ultimate fight he had surrendered the control of the
International, so long and desperately held in his
ownership, and now was ousted from the presidency, other
managers being left in charge of the wreck of a
desperate marauder's attempt to throttle a republic and
to rule a country.  And so forth, to many extra pages,
all deliciously explicit, and wondrous welcome alike to
those who purchase and those who purvey the news.
</p>

<p>
The chronicle of all this was accompanied in this
journal not only with pictures of Graystone Hall, but
of the abandoned factory of the International Power
Company; also with portraits of Rawn and his wife
and of Charles Halsey, late superintendent of the
company; as well as those of Jim Sullivan, the
foreman, Ann Sullivan, his wife, and other labor leaders
sometimes concerned about the mysterious factory
which had housed the desperate secret of International
Power.  As it chanced, the portraits of Ann Sullivan
and Virginia Rawn had been exchanged, so that the
beautiful Mrs. Rawn appeared as a hard-featured Irish
woman of more than middle age; whereas Mrs. Sullivan,
wife of the well-known labor leader, presented a
somewhat distinguished figure in her eminently
handsome gown and obviously valuable jewels.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
Virginia Rawn looked calmly, smilingly, over these
and many other varying details of these closing scenes
in her career.  "Very well," said she, pointing to the
likeness accredited to her name, "this is the last time
my portrait will appear in print, I suppose.  What
difference does it make?  The older and uglier I am, the
better the story!  Perhaps for once Mrs. Sullivan,
when she sees her picture&mdash;young, rich, with plenty of
jewels&mdash;will think her dreams have come true!  Maybe
she's dreamed&mdash;I know I did; and I know what I am.
The names and pictures are right, just as they are.
She wins, not I.
</p>

<p>
"But yes, I suppose this is the end of it all, as you
say," she added wearily, almost indifferently.  "Of
course, we've known it was coming.  I suppose there
was nothing else <i>could</i> come of it all."
</p>

<p>
Halsey at first could make no answer except to drop
his face in his hands.  A half groan escaped him, in
spite of his attempt to rival her courage or her
indifference, whichever it might be.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I've</i> done this," he said at last; "<i>I've</i> brought all
this on you.  It's all my fault, and it's too late now for
me to help it.  We couldn't straighten out things in
the business now, even if I went back to work.  It's too
late.  I've ruined you, Mrs. Rawn."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's plain," she answered quietly.  "But
isn't this just what you wanted?  Haven't you always
resented the success of others, deprecated the wish of
some men to get money at any cost?  Aren't you a
Socialist at heart?  Didn't you want this&mdash;just this?"
</p>

<p>
"Want it?  No!  How could I want anything which
meant harm for <i>you</i>?  If only you had come to me and
asked me to go back&mdash;asked me to get into line!"
</p>

<p>
"You'd have done it, wouldn't you, Charley&mdash;for
me?"  She smiled at him, her small, white teeth showing.
But back of her smile he felt the pulse of a mind.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know&mdash;how could I have helped it?"
</p>

<p>
"Then you'd have forgotten all your loyalty to those
people over there?  You'd have forgotten all about the
rights of man of which you told me, and your devotion
to the principles of this republic of which you talked&mdash;is
that true?  You'd have forgotten all, everything, for
<i>me</i>?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I would!"  He looked her fair in the eye,
truthfully.  "I know that, now&mdash;I didn't know it then,
but I do now.  Yes, I would.  Just as I told him&mdash;Mr. Rawn."
</p>

<p>
"You told him, what?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, that we all have our price.  I suppose I had
mine."
</p>

<p>
"So you'd have done that if I had asked you?"
</p>

<p>
"Then in God's name why did you not ask me?  At
least, I'd have saved you <i>this</i>!"  He smote on the
paper with his clenched fist.  "Why didn't you ask me
to save you this humiliation?"
</p>

<p>
"I did not, because I knew all along what you'd do
if I did ask you."
</p>

<p>
Silence fell between them now.  "Why didn't you?"
he once more demanded, half-whispering.  "You'd
already won.  You'd have won me&mdash;my principles&mdash;my
honor."
</p>

<p>
"Because I did not <i>want to win</i>!" she answered
sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Win what?"
</p>

<p>
"I was sent to bring you into camp, to 'get' you,
Charley.  I did not want to&mdash;I did not!  I was afraid
I <i>would</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I quite understand."
</p>

<p>
His face was white, his voice low and clear, his eye
full on hers.
</p>

<p>
"I was sent out for you, Charley&mdash;by my own husband!
You know it, we both knew it.  I suppose he's
been waiting somewhere for me to get word to him
that I had done what I was told to do&mdash;that I had got
you in hand, willing to renounce everything that you
held good in your own life.  Well, it's too late, now!
I'm glad!"
</p>

<p>
"He sent you out after me!&mdash;With what restrictions&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"None.  He didn't care how.  He told me he didn't.
That's why I've been keeping away from you.  I was
afraid I'd win&mdash;I was afraid I'd save all this."
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head, including the splendors of
the mansion house, its view of the lake, all the
gracious, delicate ministries of Wealth.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
"Good God!" Halsey broke out.  "The man who
would do that is not worth a woman's second thought."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not.  And the woman who would do
that&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask me about that; I can't think.  All I know
is that if you had asked me to do anything in the
world, I think I'd have said yes."
</p>

<p>
"For me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, for you.  It's the truth.  It's all out, at last!
There's the whole story now of John Rawn&mdash;all of it,
in black and white!  Here's all <i>my</i> story&mdash;to you.
You must have known&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she nodded; "of course.  That was why, I
said, that I've evaded you so long.  It was very hard
to do, Charley; a hundred times I've been on the point
of sending for you.  But I didn't."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad, too," he said simply, seeing it was to
be soul facing soul, between them now.  "I've missed
you.  I've never passed such days in my life as I have
here.  There's Grace hating me, you ought to hate
me&mdash;I ought to hate you!  Oh, Rawn, man!  Where
would you have stopped, to get money, to get power?
Oh, excellent!&mdash;to set your wife as a trap for another
man!  But it worked!  It could have been done!"  He
looked her frankly in the face as he finished.  "I love
you, Virginia," he said simply.  "I suppose I have all
along.  It's cheap, after all&mdash;at this price.  But for all
this, I never could have told you.
</p>

<p>
"But one thing I will say,"&mdash;the unhappy young
man added, after a long time; "it's the one thing I
can claim for an excuse.  <i>My</i> price was love for you,
and <i>good</i> love.  It was the whole love of man for
woman&mdash;I never knew before what that meant!  It
wasn't for money, but for you.  That great, mysterious
second current&mdash;what you yourself said was the one
vast power of all the universe&mdash;that belonged to
<i>everybody</i>&mdash;love&mdash;love&mdash;I thought <i>that</i> belonged to me, too.
I can't see even now where that is wrong.  I can't
think, I don't know.  If it is wrong, then I've been
wrong.  We're down in the mire together!  I dragged
you there.  And once I dreamed of doing something
to lift people up&mdash;that was why I mutinied and tore
up the motors.  And I had my own selfish price....
I can never lift up my head again.  But I love
you!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
She looked at him, her lips parted, her bosom agitated
now, her eyes large, her color slowly increasing.
"You must not!&mdash;Stop, we must think!  Charley&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But why didn't you?" he demanded fiercely.  "Why
didn't you finish your work as you promised?"
</p>

<p>
"I never promised.  I didn't finish it&mdash;because I
knew I <i>could</i>.  I told you&mdash;it was&mdash;Charley&mdash;yes&mdash;it
was&mdash;love!"
</p>

<p>
"For me?"
</p>

<p>
He half started up now, but she raised a hand to
restrain him.
</p>

<p>
"The servants!" she whispered.  Indeed, even as
she spoke she saw the livery of the butler disappearing
at the tall glass doors letting out to the gallery.  She
did not know that the butler had seen much and heard
somewhat; that being a butler he was wise.
</p>

<p>
"But it's got to be&mdash;we've got to go through now!"
he went on savagely.  "Why did you start this, then?
Why did you let me know?"
</p>

<p>
"It was he who started it in me&mdash;ambition!  No, I
always had it.  From the day I was born I wanted to
climb, to win, to be rich, to have things in my hands.
All girls want that, I suppose, till they know how little
it is.  So I married him&mdash;I tried to, and I did.  I knew
he had money....  But then there was more I wanted,
after all.  I only wanted that something <i>else</i>, too, that
any woman wants&mdash;what she's got to have, once in
her life, rich or poor, because she's a woman&mdash;some
one who truly loves her for herself as she is, because
she is what she is&mdash;because she's a woman!
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I looked all around me here, a long time after
I came here, for what I'd missed.  I've never been
happy here.  I didn't have it.  I wanted it.  At last
I saw it.  I wanted it.  Its price is ruin&mdash;for two,
you and me.  I'm like you.  If it's wrong, I don't
know where the wrong began!  I didn't mind, so far
as I was concerned.  Let a woman love you, and she'll
do anything, no matter how it hurts&mdash;herself.  But
not <i>you</i>&mdash;not the man she loves and wants to respect,
Charley."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;me?  I am not good enough for you!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, boy!  How sweet that sounds to me!  Say it
over again to me!  You make me think I might some
day be worth a man's love.  It's got away from us
now.  It's all too late.  Everything's too late.  When
he&mdash;Mr. Rawn&mdash;comes back, we've got to tell him.
I've done what I was set to do&mdash;but not the way he
thought, not the way any of us thought!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IX
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he must know!"  Halsey nodded.  He held her
hand now in his own.  They swept on, as upon some
vast wave, helpless, clinging to each other, he doing
what he could to save her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how to tell him," she wailed.  "There
was something Pagan in me and I didn't know it.  I
thought I was in hand, but I wasn't!  I started low,
and I wanted to climb up&mdash;and up&mdash;and up!  Oh,
Charley, look!"  She leaned toward him across the
table, pleading.  "I was just ambitions, just like any
American girl&mdash;like every woman in the world, I
suppose.  If I sold out, I didn't know it.  I didn't <i>want</i>
you to care for me.  But you did, you do!  I kept
away from you, so that you wouldn't, so that we
<i>couldn't</i>&mdash;so that I'd always feel that <i>you</i>, at least&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Where can it end?" he asked quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care where it ends, that's the worst of it;
I don't care!  One thing only is to my credit.  I've
kept my bargain&mdash;with him.  I've paid the price I
agreed to give.  There is no scandal about me&mdash;yet.
And there might have been!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"But some way, when he sent me out for you, talked
to me as he did, treated me like a piece of merchandise
as he did&mdash;for once I wavered.  For once, Charley,
it seemed to me that I was released from all obligations
to him, that I was where I ought to have a chance
for my own hand, to see life as life could be for itself,
to have the love that's life for a woman.  I wanted to
be wooed and won by some one who loved me, just as
any woman wants to be, Charley, some time!  And I
wasn't&mdash;I wasn't....  It was horrible....  It
was horrible....  I wanted to give love for love.
I wanted what I couldn't get, and saw it was too late
to get it fair.  And when I saw that you&mdash;that even
you'd sell out for <i>me</i>&mdash;why, where was the good, clean
thing left in all the world?  I couldn't tell.  I didn't
know what to do.  I don't know now.  But you put
these papers before me now, and you expect me to
shed tears over them.  I can't.  I don't care.  The
worst was over for me before now.  It came when I
knew you'd love me if I'd raise a finger to you.  Why
didn't you make me love you first&mdash;long ago?  <i>Then</i>
all would have come right.  Back there&mdash;at first&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They'll say that when your husband lost his fortune
he lost his wife.  Yes&mdash;" he nodded.  "They'll
say that and believe it!  That isn't true!"
</p>

<p>
"No, that isn't true.  I was done with him the
moment he set this errand for me.  No woman can
love a man who will do that.  But I was done with
him&mdash;from the first I never loved him, I never did&mdash;I
only married him!  I sold out&mdash;what I had to sell,
myself, my fitness for a place like this.  That was what
I called success!  I wanted to be some one in the
world!  Look at me now&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
X
</p>

<p>
They sat, two figures in an inexorable drama that
swept relentlessly forward; tasting of a part of
ambition's ripened fruit; yet hungering with the vast,
pitiful, merciless human hunger for that other fruit
that hung in a garden once not lost.
</p>

<p>
"If it costs my soul, I'll stand by you," he said at
last; and he reached out a hand to her suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" she cried.  "Wait!  Wait!  I want to
think!"
</p>

<p>
A discreet cough sounded.  The butler approached
bearing coffee.  He wore a half sneer on his face now,
the sneer of the unpaid mercenary.  He doubted, and
had cause to doubt, whether the last month's salary
would be forthcoming; for butlers read morning
papers.  "Ah, er, Mrs. Rawn&mdash;" he began.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?  How dare you speak to me!"
she rejoined.  "I do not care to be disturbed!  You
may go!"
</p>

<p>
He did go; and this was on an errand of his own,
an errand which ended in Grace Halsey's chambers.
For butlers sometimes take ingenious revenge.

</p>

<p>
Halsey and Virginia Rawn sat on for a time at the
table, the almost untasted breakfast before them.  The
sun grew warmer.  After a time she rose, and they
passed from the gallery toward the interior of the
house.  The tray upon the hall table held a scanty
morning load for it&mdash;one letter and a telegram; the
former addressed to Mrs. Charles Halsey, the latter
to herself.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I?" she asked, and tore the envelope across.
</p>

<p>
"It must be from him," he said.  She tossed it to
him.
</p>

<p>
"Home to-night.  JOHN RAWN."

<p>
The blood of youth is hot.  He followed her, in
spite of all, forgetting all.  They had advanced
across the hall toward the gold room, or library.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Charley, Charley!  Don't begin, wait a little,"
she wailed.  "At least till to-night, till afternoon.  I
don't know what to say yet.  I don't know what to
do!  Let us see him first, and tell him."
</p>

<p>
"Look about you," he commented grimly.  "You're
going to lose all this&mdash;all these splendid, beautiful
things."
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind losing them.  I want to be poor.  Oh,
my God!  Just to be loved, and clean!  Charley, can
we?"
</p>

<p>
"But why choose me?  There are so many others!"
</p>

<p>
"All like Mr. Rawn himself&mdash;men crazed of money,
power, selfishness.  I wanted something different.  Do
you think it could have been my father's old ideas
coming out in me, so late?  He came of a family of
revolutionists&mdash;independents; 'Progressives,' they call
them now.  Something of his beliefs&mdash;I don't know
what it was&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But you'll have to leave him in any case.  Divorce
is simple enough.  You know what I would have done,
and done, also, in any case.  Grace and I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know all about everything.  Everything's
past," she said despairingly.  "We're dead.  It's all
over!"
</p>

<p>
"I ought to go?" he asked vaguely.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, pretty soon.  But I suppose you'll have to see
Grace, and&mdash;to-night I'll have to see&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He bowed his head.  "Yes, we've got to pay that
part first.  The best we can do and all we can give
ought to be enough for him."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
She turned, left him, passing through the great
doors to the central rooms within.  Following her
still, he found her at the stair and joined her.  There
approached them now, with hasty tread and face
somewhat excited, the medical man who had been for so
many days now in attendance upon Grace Rawn and
her child.  He had come on his morning visit
unnoticed by them.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," he began, "I'm glad to find you, Mrs. Rawn&mdash;and
you, Mr. Halsey&mdash;I've been looking for you&mdash;Come!
Come quickly!"  His face showed plainly his
agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Is there anything wrong?" demanded Halsey
sharply.  "What's the trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"It is my duty to tell you the truth," began the
doctor.  "Your wife is a very sick woman, indeed."
</p>

<p>
"I know that, yes."
</p>

<p>
"But not the worst until this morning, until just
now.  Something&mdash;"
</p>

(Virginia and Halsey)
</p>

<p>
"I've been here in the house waiting&mdash;why did you
not call me?" began Halsey clumsily.
</p>

<p>
"You must not <i>wait</i>!" the doctor interrupted him,
taking him by the arm and hastening toward the
stairway.
</p>

<p>
They followed him up the stair, down the upper
hall, to the rooms which had been set apart of late
days for Grace and her child, quarters all too
unfamiliar to Halsey himself.
</p>

<p>
They found Grace Halsey, faint and gasping, half
sitting in her bed, clasping the child in her arms,
herself too weak now longer to hold it up.  Halsey,
stricken with sudden horror, ran to take the child in his own
arms.
</p>

<p>
The truth was obvious.  Even as he lifted the poor
crippled form in his arms, the head fell back, helpless.
The eyes glazed, turned back uncovered.  Halsey cried
out aloud.  He turned about, dazed; horror and
helplessness were on his face.  It was to Virginia Rawn he
turned, as to the other part of himself.
</p>

<p>
It was Virginia Rawn who took from him the feeble,
misshapen body, gathering it into her own arms.  She
gazed intently, frowning, grieving a woman's grief
over suffering, bending over its face; her own face
held back over it when she saw the truth.  Then she
passed him and placed the body of the child upon its
cot near-by, covering it gently.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
"Grace, Grace!" sobbed Halsey.  He fell upon his
knees at his wife's bedside.  She did not see him, did
not recognize him, although she turned a questioning
face toward him.  "Me, too!" he cried.  "I want to go!
I want to die and end it!  Everything's wrong..."
</p>

<p>
"Come," said the doctor presently; "it's too late
now.  I'll call for you after a time."  He took Halsey
by the arm and led him from the room.  Returning, he
signed for Virginia Rawn also to leave the sick chamber.
Left alone, the medical man turned to the professional
nurse in attendance.  "Keep it quiet," he said.
"It would hurt my practice&mdash;do you hear?"
</p>

<p>
He kicked beneath the bed a small broken vial, and
wiped away the stain from the lips of the dying
woman.
</p>

<p>
The doctor, of course, had his guess, the public its
guess, the daily papers theirs.  The truth was, Grace
Halsey, by butler route, had learned of the <i>t√™te-√†-t√™te</i>
of her husband and her stepmother a half hour before
this time.

CHAPTER X
<br />
THOSE WHO REAP THE WHIRLWIND
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Grace Halsey, dead, her crippled child dead
beside her, never knew the contents of the letter
which had been received for her that morning.  It still
laid on the hall table unnoticed.  There was almost
none to pay attention to the many duties of the
household.  The last servants had begun to pass, scenting
disaster even as had others.  The magic which had
builded this mansion house now lacked strength to
hold its tenantry.  There remained now only one
man&mdash;the butler, lingering for his pay.  Only two persons
might still be said to be actuated by any sense of
loyalty or duty to Graystone Hall and its
owner&mdash;Halsey and Virginia Rawn.
</p>

<p>
Of duty&mdash;to what and to whom?  They dared not
ask, dared not think.  They waited, they knew not for
what.  The master of this mansion house was forth
upon his business.  Somewhere, he was hastening
toward his home.  When he might be expected they
did not know.  Nor did the master know what news
awaited him upon his coming.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
The evening dailies came out upon the streets, reeling
and reeking with the last accumulating sensations
of the Rawn disasters.  The business world continued
to rub its eyes, the social world continued to exult.
Many and many a woman smiled that evening as she
contemplated proofs of the downfall of one whom
once she had envied.  The Rawns, it now seemed, had
all along been known, by everybody who was anybody,
to have been nobody at all.  They who had sown the
wind, had the whirlwind for their reaping.  This was
the general day of harvest for Graystone Hall.
</p>

<p>
But the day passed on.  Shadows lengthened beyond
the tall towers and softened as they fell toward
the east.  The soft airs of evening, turning, came in
across the open gallery front.  Night came, night
unbroken by more than a few lights in all the myriad
windows of this stately monument which John Rawn
had builded as proof of his personal success.  Vehicles,
passing slowly, held occupants staring in curiosity at
this vast, vacant pile.  Human sympathy lacked,
human aid there was not.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Thus it chanced easily that there passed up the long
driveway of Graystone Hall, almost unnoticed, a
vehicle carrying one who seemed a stranger there; an
elderly, rather tall woman of gray hair and unfashionable
garb, who made such insistence with the servant
at the door that at length she won her way through.
</p>

<p>
Her errand seemed not one of curiosity, nor did she
lack in decision.  She left upon the table an old-fashioned
reticule, and following the advice given her, in
reply to her question, passed up the stair and down the
upper hall, to the room where lay Grace Halsey and
her child.  There, unknown by any of the household
and accepted by those whose professional duties took
them thither, she remained for many hours.  Halsey
and Virginia Rawn did not know of her coming.
</p>

<p>
It was a cold home-coming, also, which awaited John
Rawn.  But he came at last, to meet that which was
for him to encounter.  It was night.  The lights were
few and dim.  None greeted him at his own gate, none
even at his own door, which was left unguarded.  At
length he found the solitary footman-butler, asleep in
a chair, the worse for wine.
</p>

<p>
"Where is she?" he demanded.  "Where is Mrs. Rawn?"
</p>

<p>
He turned before he could be coherently answered,
and passed down the hall toward the library, through
whose closed doors he saw a faint light gleaming.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Something impelled John Rawn to hesitate.  He
stood, himself the very picture of despair, his face
drawn, haggard, unshaven, his hair disordered, his
hands twitching.  He must find his wife, he said to
himself; he must ask her what success she had had
with their last hope.  Yes, yes, it must be true!  With
Halsey's aid he would yet win!  If she had won&mdash;Halsey
would yet be on his side&mdash;Halsey would tell
him&mdash;Halsey would go back to the factory&mdash;
</p>

<p>
But John Rawn hesitated at this door.  He felt,
rather than knew, believed rather than was advised,
that his wife was beyond that door.  He waited,
apprehensive, but kept up with himself the pitiful pretense
of self-deception.  Ah, power, control, command!&mdash;those
were the great things of the world, he reasoned.
True, he knew his daughter lay dead in her room on
the floor above&mdash;the paper he held in his hand told
him that; for at last the doctor had prepared his
statement regarding Mrs. Halsey's death by "heart
failure"&mdash;the rich and all akin to them always die respectably,
in a house so large as Graystone Hall.  But it was too
late to save her, Rawn reasoned.  Let the dead bury
the dead.  The larger things must outweigh the small.
He first must know what his wife had done with
Halsey.
</p>

<p>
To the tense, strained nerves of John Rawn the
truth was now as apparent as it had been to the
sensibilities of all these others, late friends, servants,
sycophants.  Ruin was here, in his citadel, his castle of
pride.  Only one thing could save him....  He
hesitated at the door, held back from that which he
knew he was about to face....  But no, he
reasoned, she was there alone, he <i>must</i> see her!
</p>

<p>
He flung open the folding doors and stood holding
them apart.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Yes, she was there!  John Rawn's face drew into a
ghastly smile.  Yes, she had won!  She, the wonderful
woman, had triumphed as he had planned for her
to triumph.  She had won! ...
</p>

<p>
They stood before him, those two, silent, face to
face, embraced; their arms about each other even as
he flung wide the door.  They turned to him now,
stupefied, so weary, so overstrained, that their arms
still hung, embraced.  The face of each was white,
desolate, unhappy; more hopeless and desperate than
terrified, but horrible.  They were lovers.  They loved,
but what could love do for them, so late?  They had
paid&mdash;but what right had they to love, so late?
</p>

<p>
John Rawn, the man who had wrought all this,
stood and gazed, ghastly, smiling distortedly, at his
wife's face.  Why, then, should she be unhappy?
What was to be lost save that which he, John Rawn,
was losing&mdash;or had been about to lose?
</p>

<p>
But he was startled, stupefied, himself, for one
moment.  He turned back, hesitating; and so tiptoed
away, leaving them, although the joint knowledge of
all was obvious.  They had not spoken a word, had not
started apart, had only gazed at him like dead persons,
white, silent, motionless&mdash;not lovers; no, not lovers.
</p>

<p>
For one-half instant, alone in the wide and darkened
hall, Rawn straightened himself up, threw his chest
out.  Yes, she had won&mdash;she had done her task!  She
held Charles Halsey fast&mdash;there&mdash;in her embrace.  He,
John Rawn, multimillionaire, collector of rare objects,
one of God's anointed rich, had the shrewdest wife the
world had ever seen, the most beautiful, the most
successful!
</p>

<p>
Had he not seen&mdash;was it not there before his
eyes?  She had his one enemy netted, in her
power&mdash;there&mdash;had he not seen?  She brought him, bound
hand and foot, to him, John Rawn!  Could a man
doubt his eyes?  They had hunted well in couple, he
and his wife, and now she had pulled down their latest
victim! ...
</p>

<p>
What mattered the means?&mdash;there was but one great
thing.  And the great things must outweigh the small.
He was a man of power.  He had been born for
success.  He was&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VI
</p>

<p>
He stood, half in the shadow, hesitant.  Then he
heard other feet approaching him slowly.  His wife,
Virginia, came and took him by the arm and had him
within the door; closed it back of him; and, leaving
him, advanced to where Halsey stood.  She took
Halsey by the hand....  It seemed a singular thing
to Rawn, this performance; in fact, almost improper,
if the truth were known....  So it seemed to John
Rawn's mind, a trifle clouded with distress and drink.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said she apathetically; and held her peace
as he frowned and looked at her dumbly.
</p>

<p>
"Well!" he broke out at last; "I'm back
again!&mdash;  You're <i>here</i>, I see."  This last to Halsey.
</p>

<p>
They two stood and regarded him without comment.
Halsey kept his eye on Rawn's hand, expecting
some sudden movement for a weapon.  He was incredulous
that any man could sustain Rawn's attitude
toward him.  War, and nothing but war, seemed
inevitable between himself and Rawn, the man whom he
had wronged, the man who had wronged him.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose&mdash;I see&mdash;" began Rawn clumsily, after
a while.  "Of course, you have probably been here all
the time, Charley.  I came back as soon as I could.
I've been having all kinds of trouble in St. Louis and
New York.  Everything's all gone to pieces."
</p>

<p>
They did not answer him, and he shuffled.
</p>

<p>
"Have you anything to say?" he demanded of his
wife; "Has Mr. Halsey&mdash;Charley&mdash;agreed?&mdash;Have
you persuaded him to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You wish to know, whether I have done what I
was told to do&mdash;is that it?" she demanded of him
coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; have you?"
</p>

<p>
"I have.  Here is Mr. Halsey.  I have kept my
word.  You have seen.  I told you I could bring him
in, bound hand and foot.  Kiss me, Charley," she
cried.  "Oh! kiss me!"  And he did kiss her.  Cold,
white, hand in hand, dead, they then faced him again.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VII
</p>

<p>
"Is it true?" began Rawn.  His eyes lighted up
suddenly.  "He has agreed?"
</p>

<p>
Halsey broke in now.  "It is true, Mr. Rawn," said
he.  "I love her.  I love your wife; I can't help it.  I
have told her so.  You see."
</p>

<p>
"You love her!"  John Rawn burst out into a great,
croaking-laugh.  "You <i>love</i> her?  I say, that's good!
That's good news to tell me, isn't it?  Why&mdash;I sent
her&mdash;I used her, to <i>make</i> you love her!  You see
reason now at last, do you?&mdash;every man does at
last&mdash;every man has his price.  You'll go back to work
to-morrow?  There's a lot to do, but we can save it all
yet.  We can whip them, I tell you&mdash;we'll get everything
back in our own hands before to-morrow night!"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;But, Mr. Rawn!  Listen!  You do not know!
Surely you do not understand&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Understand?  What is there left to understand?
Didn't I see you both just now?  Didn't you&mdash;right
now&mdash;haven't you <i>got</i> to come across now?  Hasn't
she done what I told her to do; what she said she'd
do?  I told her to bring you back to us again, and
she's done it, hasn't she?
</p>

<p>
"But come on, now," he resumed, as though reluctantly&mdash;"I
suppose we've got to go up there&mdash;Grace&mdash;?
Too bad....  But I wanted to see Jennie first."
</p>

<p>
"My God!" whispered Virginia Rawn, shuddering.
"Oh, my God!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
"Rawn," said Halsey directly, abandoning even any
pretense at courtesy; "the end of the world has come
for you, for us all.  My wife is dead&mdash;she's lucky!  My
child is dead, too, and that's lucky.  It had no life to
live, crippled as it was.  She killed herself and the
baby.  I don't seem to care as I ought to care.  And
now your wife has told me that she loves me.  It's
true!  She doesn't love <i>you</i>; she never has.  She has
not taken me a prisoner any more than I have her.
We're both in this to-night.  We're both to blame.
But, at the bottom, you are to blame&mdash;for <i>all</i> of this."
</p>

<p>
"Of course!  Of course!" smiled John Rawn
sardonically.  "What would you expect?  I am sorry.
But I'll never tell any one about it, you can depend on
that!"
</p>

<p>
"You'll never tell!" went on Charles Halsey slowly.
"You'll never <i>need</i> to tell.  But here's what I want to
tell <i>you</i>, once more.  Whatever this is&mdash;and it's about
bad enough&mdash;it's come because of <i>you</i>.  You&mdash;you
were the cause of this!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>You blame me</i>&mdash;why, what do you mean!" burst
out John Rawn.  "Where have <i>I</i> been to blame, I'd
like to know!  What do you mean, young man?"
</p>

<p>
"Every word I have told you, and more than I can
tell you.  You'll not think&mdash;you don't dare to face the
truth; but there's the real truth.  If you can't
understand that, take what you can understand.  Your wife
isn't to blame&mdash;I'm to blame.  Love is to blame.  I
love her.  I've done this."
</p>

<p>
"You have done&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"I've taken your wife away from you, can't you
understand, you fool?  She's going to marry me as
soon&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Jennie</i>!&mdash;what's this fellow talking about?"  The
veins on John Rawn's forehead stood high and full.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IX
</p>

<p>
"He is only telling you the truth," she said calmly,
wearily.  "I don't care one picayune whether or not
you know it, whether or not the world knows it!  I'm
tired!  I'm done with all this sort of thing!  Yes, I'm
going to marry him as soon as we can get away.  As
soon as it's decent, if anything's decent any more!"
</p>

<p>
"And you love him, you'll rob <i>me</i>, you'll leave
<i>me</i>&mdash;you'll&mdash;why, are you all crazy?  What are you talking
about?  When I've given you everything you've
got&mdash;when you were so much to me!  <i>Jennie!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" she raised a hand.  "Don't talk about
that!  It's all over now."
</p>

<p>
She tore at her throat, at her fingers, heaped up in
his hands the gems she wore even then, the gems she
had put upon her person to protect them from
uncertain servants, gems which left her blazing like some
waxen queen in her tomb&mdash;white, dead, enjeweled.
</p>

<p>
"Take them!" she cried.  "I don't want them."  She
went on, piling his hands full of glittering, flashing
things.  He stood gazing at her, stupefied.  Then,
slowly, the burden of years, the burden of business
failure, and lastly this&mdash;the burden of the worst of
man's discomfiture, the worst of a man's possible
losses&mdash;began to weigh down upon him.  He shortened
visibly; shriveled; drooped.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
X
</p>

<p>
They had no pity for him.  Youth has no pity for
age, love no pity for a mate's inefficiency; but after all
some sort of contempt, at least, seemed due him.
</p>

<p>
"Rawn," said Halsey, "it's pretty hard.  We're all
of us paying a hard, heavy price for what we thought
we had.  But we can't evade it, any part of it.  It was
your fault that Grace left me.  We were going to part.
You sent your wife after me, as you call it.  I suppose
Grace found that out.  You know what she did then.
I said I blame you, and so I do.  But I was going to
get a divorce&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Divorce!&mdash;you divorce my daughter!  John
Rawn's daughter!"
</p>

<p>
"Did you not divorce her mother&mdash;you, yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"But I loved&mdash;my wife&mdash;I mean, this woman&mdash;Jennie, here!"
</p>

<p>
"So do <i>I</i> love her; more than you do or ever will
know how to do!  What you have done we'll do.  Is
it worse for us than it was for you?  What's the
difference?"
</p>

<p>
"But she's my <i>wife</i>!  Why, <i>Jennie</i>!"  He held out
a hand to her.
</p>

<p>
"So was Laura Rawn your wife, my wife's mother,"
went on Halsey.  "What's the difference?"
</p>

<p>
Virginia Rawn stepped between the two.  "I'm as
much to blame as any one of us all," she said quietly.
"I sold out to you, didn't I, Mr. Rawn&mdash;down there
in New York?  I married you, didn't I?  Very well,
what you did, I have done.  No more, and not without
equal cause.  I love him.  I'm going to marry him.
You and I are going to be divorced&mdash;if we were not
I'd go to him anyhow.  I hate you, I loathe you!  My
God! how I detest and loathe the sight of you!  Go
away&mdash;go away from us!  You're not any part of a
man!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
XI
</p>

<p>
"It's true!" gasped John Rawn to himself; "My
God, it's true!  She said that&mdash;I heard her&mdash;to me?
What have I done to deserve this? ... I ought to
kill you," said he to Halsey slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you ought," said Halsey.  "If you were
any portion of a man you would.  But you've tried
that, and you know where you ended."
</p>

<p>
"But Halsey&mdash;Charley!&mdash;you don't stop to think!"
began Rawn pitifully.  "You will go back&mdash;you will
go back to the factory, in the morning?  You will help
me pull it together, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not one step back to the factory&mdash;never in the
world!  I'm done with that.  I'm going away somewhere,
and she's going with me, I don't know where.
Let some one else work out what you thought we could
do, and let some one else take the consequences&mdash;it's
not for me.  You've got what you earned&mdash;I suppose
I'll get what I've earned, too.  I don't care about that
any more."
</p>

<p>
Rawn could not answer the young man as he went
on, slowly, dully, bitterly.  "If I've been traitor to any
of my own creed I reckon God'll punish me.  Very
well; I will take my punishment on my shoulders.
I've no apologies to make in a place like this.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you gone up&mdash;oughtn't we to go up now&mdash;up-stairs?"
he added at last.  He put down Virginia's
arms from his shoulders; for once more she had come
to him.
</p>

<p>
Rawn sighed.  "I suppose I must go up there," he
said vaguely.
</p>

<p>
He turned and walked away, heavy, stumbling.

CHAPTER XI
<br />
THE MEANS&mdash;AND THE END
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Halsey turned toward Virginia.  They did not
again embrace, but stood silent, almost apathetic
now.  Passion was far away from them, indeed had
never fully seized them.  The despair in human love
was theirs; and love is half despair.  She might have
been some beautiful statue in white marble, so cold was
she; and as for the man who faced her, his anger gone,
he himself might have been the image of hopelessness.
Central figures of an irreparable ruin, and seeing no
avenue to happiness, for the time neither had word for
the other.
</p>

<p>
At last Halsey raised his head, as some sound
caught his ear.  "What's that?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"I heard it," said she.  "I think it's some one
coming up the walk."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered.  "Listen!  Why, it sounds like
a crowd.  What can that mean, now?  Wait."
</p>

<p>
He left her and hastened out to the front door.  He
stood there, outlined fully by the hall lights behind
him.  Those who approached recognized him.  He
was greeted by a derisive shout, half-maudlin, scarce
human in its quality.  The solitary servant rushed up,
excited.  "What is it, Mr. Halsey?" he quavered.  "Is
there going to be any trouble?  Oh, I ought to have
gone away with the others!"
</p>

<p>
"Get out of the way," replied Halsey calmly.  "Get
back behind the door.  I'll go out and meet them."
</p>

<p>
"Here, you men!" he called out in sudden anger to
the visitors.  "What do you mean, coming here this
way?"  He was advancing toward them now, down
the steps, into the curving walk, almost to the rim of
the circle of light cast by the house lights.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know any better than to come here at
this time, you people?  There's trouble in this house.
There's death in here.  Go on away, at once!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
The leader of the scattered group of ill-dressed men
stepped forward.  "No, we'll not go on away at once.
We know who you are, all right, Mr. Halsey.  Trouble!
We're in trouble, too!  We're lookin' for some more
trouble, now."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not to blame for that.  What do you
mean?  Who are you, anyway?"
</p>

<p>
"You ought to know us!  We've done up some of
your damned sneaks.  You cut your workmen down to
the last copper in wages, and you didn't pay them that.
Then when the pinch came, you shut the doors and
slunk off, like the coward you was!  Then they came
over to us, at last!  Your scabs is in the unions now."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't done anything of the kind!" retorted
Halsey hotly.  "I haven't been to the factory for days.
When I left there, every cent was paid up.  That
wasn't any of my business anyhow&mdash;I was not cashier,
but factory superintendent."
</p>

<p>
"It's a lie, you know it's a lie!  We've come to show
you up.  We've come to take old man Rawn and you
out of this place.  We ought to ride him on a rail, and
you with him!  That's what we ought to do!  We
want that money."  The leader advanced toward him
menacingly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, men, I have not got your money&mdash;" expostulated
Halsey.  "If I had, this isn't the way to get it
from me!  I've always used you fellows square!
You've got to act that way with me.  I'm in trouble
now, I tell you.  My wife's dead, and my baby&mdash;to-day&mdash;in
here.  You are accusing the best friend you have
got!  Where's Jim Sullivan?  Where's Tim Carney?
Where's any of you men that used to work with me
there in the factory?  Any one of you ought to know
better."
</p>

<p>
"They ain't here; but don't talk that to us!  We
know what you was doing with them machines.  We
know what you was up to.  You wanted to take the
bread out of our mouths!  We seen it all in the papers,
the whole thing, plain enough.  No wonder you kept it
all blind as you could&mdash;you wanted to put us off the
earth."
</p>

<p>
"It's a lie!" cried Halsey sternly.  "I broke them
up.  I threw up my job.  I quit because I didn't want
to see the bread taken out of your mouths.  I stood
between the company and just what you say.  I
wouldn't allow them to make it harder for you than it
was.  I never lost you a cent of wages&mdash;I stood for
you all the time, I'm with you now.  Why, men, I've
been at your meetings, I'm one of you!  Don't you
know?  Don't you remember?  You've never asked a
thing of me I haven't tried to do, that was in reason.
You know me!  What difference about the union if
I'm your sort?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ve <i>do</i> know you!" broke in a squat and pallid
Jew, forcing himself through the thick to the front,
and usurping the place of the wavering leader.  "By
Gott, ve do know you, Mister Halsey!  You'fe lied
to us, that's vat you'fe done!  You'fe been to our
meetings, yess, but you'fe betrayed us!  I seen you
there, yess!"
</p>

<p>
"That's not true!" answered Halsey hotly.  "There
isn't a word of truth in it!  I've lost everything in
the world I've got just <i>because</i> that isn't true.  My
wife's lying dead in that house back there&mdash;just
because of that!  My child's dead there too&mdash;just
<i>because</i> of that&mdash;I've lost everything in the world I have
got&mdash;just <i>because</i> that isn't true!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
The Jew shrieked aloud, half-insane.  "To hell vith
this country!" he said.  "To hell vith the rich that
rob us.  If your vife's dead, it iss vat's right.  My
vife, she'll die too, she's starring.  To hell vith Rawn
and all like him!"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, my men, that's about enough of that!"
rejoined Halsey.  "You're drunk or crazy, and we're
not going to stand for that here.  It's no place for this
kind of talk.  I tell you, I've done all I could for you.
I haven't sided with Rawn.  If I had, I could be rich
to-day."
</p>

<p>
"You are rich!" cried the Jew; "and ve are poor.
You eat fat, you sleep soft.  You <i>are</i> rich!  But vat
do ve get?  I'm hungry!  My folks&mdash;they are starfing!
Ve haf no money.  Ve get no money for vork ve did
so long.  It buys us nothing now.  Meat is no more for
us; breat, hardly.  This <i>iss</i> no country for the people.
This <i>iss</i> no land vere laws are just.  This <i>iss</i> no
republic of man.  Jehovah, send Thy power!  Smite
and spare not, this so wrong a land!"
</p>

<p>
"You damned fanatic, shut up!" began Halsey savagely.
"Get on out of here.  You don't know your own
friends!  Who's to blame for your troubles?  Haven't
you got heads of your own?  Haven't you got votes
of your own?  Can't you right your <i>own</i> wrongs, the
first minute you get ready to do it, I'd like to know?
I'm <i>for</i> you, do you understand; but you make it hard
for any one to help you.  You've had sluggers after
our men all the time over there, and now you come and
want us to pay you for that.  You're over here to make
trouble to-night, maybe slug me&mdash;perhaps that's what
you are trying to do to me&mdash;and you want us to pay
you for <i>that</i>.  You talk about monopolies and trusts&mdash;what
you're trying to do is to make the worst trust in
the country&mdash;a monopoly in ignorance and savagery.
Go on home and let me alone!  I tell you, my wife is
dead.  I am going back to her!"
</p>

<p>
"He's lying to us!" cried out a voice in the crowd.
"He's trying to get us sorry for him!"
</p>

<p>
"That's it!" screamed the Jew, who had edged to the
front and who now stood crouched, menacing, not far
from Halsey's erect and irate frame.  "That's vhat
he iss.  He'ss only trying to fool us.  Kill him!  Ve've
vaited long enough!  Gif it to him!"  He sprang to one
side, crouching.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Those back of them, at the gallery, in the rear of
the entry, heard some sort of scuffle, a snarling of
voices, curses.  There were sounds of blows.  Then
came a flash, a shocking report; after that, a
half-instant of silence, and the sound of scattering and
departing footsteps.
</p>

<p>
There remained only one figure, lying outstretched
on the gravel.  To render succor to this, to offer aid,
there was now only one human being left in all that
place&mdash;she who now came hurrying forward.
</p>

<p>
Virginia Rawn half raised Halsey as he lay.  "Charley!"
she said quietly.  "Can you talk?"
</p>

<p>
He gasped and nodded.  "Through here!" He
touched his chest.  "I guess I'll not&mdash;be able&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She called out, to any back of her, for aid.  The
frightened servant came, and between them they got
him somehow into the house, dragging him to the
gold-room library which they had but lately left.  They
placed him there upon a couch.  Virginia Rawn rose
and waved the man away.  He hurried after help.
</p>

<p>
"Charley!" she said, turning to him; "can you talk?"
</p>

<p>
"A little.  What is it, Jennie?"
</p>

<p>
"You're hurt bad&mdash;very bad."
</p>

<p>
"Through here," he said again, and touched his
chest.  His breath was hard.  His garments were
soaked with blood.  His face was bluish-gray.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
She looked into his soul the query of her own.
Perhaps there was something not wholly unworthy in the
bond between them, since now it enabled them to talk,
one soul with the other, almost without words....
The great, secret, all-powerful, world current,
interstellar, not international, the one great power&mdash;of love,
as she once said&mdash;was theirs....  Yes, it was theirs,
if only for a little while.
</p>

<p>
"They've killed me," he began after a time&mdash;"I
tried to do something for them.  He&mdash;Rawn&mdash;would
have used it for himself.  I didn't want to....
</p>

<p>
"Jennie," he said, after a time; "I beg pardon,
Mrs. Rawn&mdash;I forgot&mdash;would you take the doll, the
little rubber one on the table there, up to the baby?
Poor little thing!  Oh, well! ..."
</p>

<p>
He sighed.  She quietly laid him back upon the
couch.  She heard the blood drip, drip, through and
across the brocaded couch, falling at the edge of the
silken rug, on the polished floor, eddying there;
thickening there.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br />
THE GREAT JOHN RAWN
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Far off, deep in the underground regions of the
city at the focus of the republic's vast industrialism,
the presses were reeling and clanging again,
heavy with their story of disaster.  The civilization of
the day went on.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere out upon the mountain tops, somewhere
in the forests, the forces of nature gathered, marched
on toward the sea.  Somewhere dumbly, mutely,
uncomplaining, the great river and its mate the great
power, inter-stellar, not international&mdash;they two, as he
but now vauntingly had dreamed, erstwhile silent
partners of John Rawn&mdash;did their work....  For
whom?  For what?  Answer that, my brothers.
The answer is your own.  As you and I shall speak in
that answer, so shall our children eat well sleep well, in
days yet to come, in this country which we still call
our own, now all too little ours.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
It was far past midnight when John Rawn again
came down the stair, sobered and whitened by what
he had seen in the death chamber.  He tiptoed now
back to the library door, through which and beneath
whose silken curtains still there pierced a little shaft of
light.  He opened the door, peered in.
</p>

<p>
He saw Virginia sitting there silent, white,
unagitated, her features cameo-sharp, her skin waxen,
indeed marble white, a woman as motionless, as silent,
apparently as little animate as the one he had left
behind him in the death chamber beyond the stair.  She
turned her eyes, not her face, toward him, but did not
speak.  The edge of her gown was moist, stained.
</p>

<p>
John Rawn looked in turn at the long figure upon
the couch, motionless, silent, its hands folded.  Neither
did it speak to him.  Suddenly oppressed, suddenly
afraid, he turned once more away.  Irresolution was in
his soul, uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
Rawn was hardly sure that he still lived, that he
still was the same John Rawn he once had known.  It
seemed impossible that all these things could have
fallen upon him, who had not deserved them!  He
pitied himself with a vast pity, revolting at the many
injustices of fortune now crowding upon him, a wholly
blameless man.  Why, a day before, he had held in his
hand power such as few men could equal; had had,
presently before him, power none other ever could
hope to equal.  That opportunity still existed.  But how
now could he avail himself of that opportunity, how
could he go on to be the great John Rawn, if this
figure on the couch could not arise, could not speak
to him, could not perform the obvious duty of rendering
needful assistance to him, John Rawn?  The cruelty
of it all rankled in the great and justice-loving
soul of Mr. Rawn.  Why, he was penniless&mdash;he&mdash;John
Rawn!  He was not even sure about his wife, yonder.
She had said things to him he could not understand,
could not believe.
</p>

<p>
He left the room, and walked still farther down the
hall, his head sagging, his lower lip pendulous, his
face warped into a pucker of self-pity&mdash;so absorbed,
that at first he did not heed an approaching footfall.
He paused almost in touch of some one who
approached him in the half-lighted hall; some one who
was coming down the stair and along the hall with
steady tread.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
There stood before him now the same tall,
gray-haired, unfashionably dressed woman whom so
recently he vaguely had noted at a distance in the hall
above; some woman apparently busy with duties
connected with the death chamber, as he had reflected
when he saw her; some neighbor, he presumed, and
certainly useful!  It was kind of her to come at this
time.  He could not, at the time, recollect that he had
seen her before.  Yes, he would reward her&mdash;he would
express his thanks.
</p>

<p>
He looked up at her now sharply, and gasped.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Laura!</i>" he exclaimed.  "Is it you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes, John," answered the tall, gaunt woman
gently.  "Didn't you see me, up there?  I suppose you
were too much troubled to notice me, John.  Yes, I'm
here.  I thought maybe I ought to come.
</p>

<p>
"But you see&mdash;this&mdash;" she held out to him the letter
she had picked up from the hall table.  "This didn't
get to her&mdash;Grace&mdash;not in time.  She died this
morning, before noon, they tell me.  She never knew her
mother was coming to her when she was in trouble.
She hadn't seen my letter to her, telling I was coming.
I knew she was in trouble&mdash;and I saw all the stories
in the papers.  I thought I'd tell her I was coming to
her&mdash;and you, John.  She was my girl, after all!  I
knew she was in trouble."
</p>

<p>
"How did you know?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, she wrote to me, of course.  A girl always
writes to her mother when she's in trouble.  She wrote
to me right often.  She wasn't&mdash;well, she wasn't happy,
John, and she often told me that.  Something wrong
was going on between her and Charley, I don't know
what."
</p>

<p>
He stood looking at her, stupefied, as she went on,
simply.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
"John, married folks oughtn't to be apart too much.
They sort of get weaned from each other.  Grace was
too ambitious.  She'd got, here, what she thought her
husband couldn't get, what she'd come to think she
had to have.  I might have told her better, but I wasn't
here.  Not that I'm reproving you, John, not at all.
Besides, we have all got to go, some day.  But I loved
her....  And the baby."
</p>

<p>
"So did I love her, and the baby," he began.  Tears
were in his eyes.  "Laura, I have had nothing but
trouble.  And now you have come here&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know; it must seem a little queer to you,
John; so I'm going right away again, to-night&mdash;before
morning, if there's any way I can get down-town."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes!"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;Because, I know if I was seen around here, and
people found out who I am, who I&mdash;was&mdash;there might
be some sort of talk which would be hard for you,
John.  I reckon you have trouble enough without that.
I didn't want to bother you.  I came mostly because
of Grace.  But&mdash;John, I always did like to tell the
truth, and I have got to tell it now&mdash;I came a little,
too, because of you!"
</p>

<p>
"Of me?  Why Laura!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did.  I read the papers, of course, all the
time.  I have known about you, although you haven't
heard of me.  You have moved up in the world, John,
and as for me&mdash;well, I have just gone back to Kelly
Row, where we used to live.  Of course, I'm glad you
have been lucky.  But then, lately, the papers all
began to say you were in trouble.  I've read all kinds of
things about you.  I heard you were ruined&mdash;that you
hadn't a dollar left in all the world!"
</p>

<p>
"It's true," he growled; "as near as I know, it's
true.  There is no hope for me now.  It's all up!"
</p>

<p>
"But, John, you had so <i>much</i> money!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but it's gone now.  It doesn't take it long to
go when it starts the other way.  The market makes a
man, and it breaks him just as quick, and a lot quicker.
It's done me, Laura.  I'm ruined.  I haven't a thing
left in the world; not even my wife.  Have you come
here to twit me with it?  What do I owe <i>you</i>, that I
have to listen to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, nothing, John, that's true; nothing at all, not
in the least.  I have no right here at all, I know that.
I understood <i>that</i>, when I&mdash;when&mdash;I went away from
here.  But that wasn't why I came back to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Then why <i>did</i> you come?  You always had the faculty,
Laura, of doing the wrong thing.  You've been a
curse to me all my life!"
</p>

<p>
"Some of that's true, John," she answered simply,
"and a good deal of it isn't.  Maybe I said the wrong
thing sometimes, or did the wrong thing.  I never had
much training.  I was meant for Kelly Row, I reckon&mdash;I'd
never have fitted in here.  We tried it!  But I
didn't come to glorify myself because you've lost this
place, and everything you had.  I just thought&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Laura, what was it that you just thought?
I can't stand here talking all the time.  It isn't right, it
isn't proper.  I'm worn out!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course it isn't, John.  I'm going right away.
But you see, when I came away I just thought this
way&mdash;here am I, an old woman that don't need much
money any more.  And there's Grace;&mdash;and maybe
now John has need for money when everybody's
turned against him.  And if he does need money,
why&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Laura?" gasped John Rawn.
"What's that you said about <i>money</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"How much would do you any good, John?" she
asked, fumbling in her bulging hand-bag.
</p>

<p>
"I might as well wish for the moon as for a dollar,"
he said bitterly.  "If I had a million, or a half million,
to-morrow, I'd pull it all together, even yet."
</p>

<p>
"A half million, John?" she said, taking out of her
bag a little, wrinkled, flat <i>porte-monnaie</i> such as women
sometimes use for carrying change in their marketing;
but still continuing her fumbling at the portly bag.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if I had a half million I could put this
company on its feet, even yet&mdash;the secret's out that
Halsey had,&mdash;but I'd get it somewhere.  I more than half
believe those fellows <i>have</i> got it, somewhere else,
somehow&mdash;that fellow Van's deep.  You see, they've
been fighting me, Laura&mdash;made up a gang against me!
I know who it was.  If I had a half million I'd throw
in with Van&mdash;he's got this secret somehow&mdash;he knows
something about it.  I'd throw in with him, and we'd
whip the others, even yet!  I'd get it all back in my
hands even yet, I tell you!
</p>

<p>
"But my God!  Why do I stand talking about such
things?  What's the use?  I'm down and out!  I'd just
as well be dead!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, John, what I always said of you was, that
you seemed to know how to get things around the way
you wanted them.  I said to myself, what a shame it
was he should have no money, when he needed it, and
I should have so much when I didn't need it.  I've got
enough set aside to keep me, I reckon, for my few
years.  And here's what you gave me;&mdash;although,
Grace&mdash;of course, John, I want enough used to put
Grace and the baby away.  The rest is yours."
</p>

<p>
He stood looking at her dumbly, as at last she
extricated from the bag a thick bundle of folded papers,
green, brown, pale pink.
</p>

<p>
"I got the bank to keep them for me," she said
simply.  "It is what you gave me&mdash;when&mdash;when I left
here&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He still stood looking at her, choking.
</p>

<p>
"Laura!" said he.  "Has God come to my aid?
This&mdash;I can't believe it!  It's a million dollars!  <i>It's
a million dollars!</i>"  His voice rose, breaking almost
to a shriek.  "It's a&mdash;  It's&mdash;a&mdash;million&mdash;<i>dollars</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, take it, John, it's yours; you're welcome to it.
I don't want it.  It's done me no good.  It's done none
of us any good.  All I want is, that you should take
care of Grace's funeral, for that's only right, John.
She was my girl, my baby, my baby!  Take care of
her.  John, I have got to go back&mdash;home!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
In the next ensuing moment or so, what swift
changes now were wrought in the late despair of our
friend and hero, Mr. John Rawn, master of the
International Power Company, already in imagination
controlling in good part the destinies of a people&mdash;the
great John Rawn, philanthropist, kindly employer,
wise friend of the less favored ones of earth; the
beneficent, kindly, omnipotent John Rawn?  Why had
he despaired, why had he ever doubted, why had he
ever set himself even momentarily apart from that
original destiny which always he had accorded to
him-self?  Was he not a leader&mdash;had he not been devised
to be so in the plans of the immortal gods, ages ago?
Was he not one of the few select ones assigned to
rule his fellow-men?
</p>

<p>
John Rawn stood before the old, gray woman, and
scarcely heard her last words.  He sighed deeply.  His
self-respect was coming back to him in waves, great,
recurrent waves.  At last a smile crossed his face.  The
imperious glance of the born ruler, of one better than
his fellow-men, the look of the man set apart and
licensed to rob and rule&mdash;returned once more to his eye.

"<i>It's a million dollars!</i>" he cried aloud, exultantly,
once more.  "It's God has sent it to me!  I'll take it as
a sign.  Watch me in the morning!  I'll make them
hunt their holes yet.  By God!  I will!"
</p>

<p>
"John, John, you mustn't swear, it isn't right!
John!"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Laura," he rejoined,
with fine condescension, every instant now becoming
more himself.  "In fact, I want to thank you&mdash;it's clever
of you, I must say.  It isn't every woman who'd have
done what you have done, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"Why wouldn't they, John?  It isn't money a woman
wants to make her happy.  I've tried that.  Grace tried
it.  It doesn't work.  It takes something else besides
money, I reckon.  We're lucky when we find that, any
of us, I reckon.  If we don't, we've got to take just
what God gives us.  But money doesn't buy everything
in the world.  John, sometimes I think it buys about as
little as anything you can think of!"  She gulped just
a little in her thin throat.
</p>

<p>
"All the same," said he firmly and generously, by
this time almost fully the great John Rawn once more,
"it was very decent of you, Laura."
</p>

<p>
"Well, never mind about that, John.  It was you
who made it.  I never did understand how you earned
it so fast.  I'm glad if it will do you any good&mdash;if you're
sure it will do you any good.  And see, John," she
added shyly, fumbling again in her bag, "I brought
you a little present, John.  I've been doing these, you
see.  I make quite a lot out of it.  I never used any of
that money you gave me, at all&mdash;I did these things&mdash;the
way I did before, when we were getting our start
together, John, you know.  I thought&mdash;maybe&mdash;you'd
like a pair."

<p>
She held out to him a pair of braces, embroidered
carefully in silks.  He took them in his hand.  She also
looked at them closely, in professional scrutiny, her
steel bowed spectacles on nose.  She pronounced them
good.
</p>

<p>
"But, John," she added curiously&mdash;"you know,
while I was up there, doing what I could for Grace and
the baby&mdash;it seemed to me like as if I heard some
funny sort of noise down here&mdash;something like a shot.
What was it?"
</p>

<p>
"It was some of those confounded laboring people,"
said John Rawn, frowning.  "Yes&mdash;they came here
after Halsey."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?  But was anybody hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said John Rawn, "Halsey&mdash;Charley Halsey&mdash;you
remember him, I believe?  Well, they shot him.
</p>

<p>
&mdash;"Good-night, Laura," he added suddenly, and held
out his hand to her, generously, nobly.  "I'm very
sleepy.  I've been up so long&mdash;and I've a lot to do
to-morrow.  After all, there's no use in <i>our</i> having hard
feelings.  Good-by."
